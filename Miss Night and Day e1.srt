00:01:43.102 --> 00:01:43.937
Hey, kid.

00:01:44.896 --> 00:01:47.440
- You'll get the highest score on the exam.
- Me?

00:01:47.524 --> 00:01:49.609
But when it comes to getting a job…

00:01:49.692 --> 00:01:50.985
Come here for a second.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.198
It can't be done
with just grit or perseverance.

00:01:55.281 --> 00:01:57.659
Isn't it time you realized that by now?

00:01:57.742 --> 00:01:58.785
Who are you?

00:01:58.868 --> 00:02:02.914
You could say I'm like a miracle worker
that makes the impossible possible.

00:02:03.498 --> 00:02:05.875
I don't believe in luck or miracles.

00:02:06.918 --> 00:02:08.878
The world might deceive you,

00:02:08.962 --> 00:02:12.507
but a miraculous business card
could change your life.

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:30.358
I pray to the heavens.

00:02:31.025 --> 00:02:35.113
Please let our Mi-jin pass
her civil service exam.

00:02:35.196 --> 00:02:38.783
She's been studying her tail off
for eight straight years,

00:02:38.867 --> 00:02:41.202
and she's failed each time!

00:02:41.286 --> 00:02:44.789
There's no misfortune
as disastrous as this.

00:02:45.582 --> 00:02:46.791
If she fails again this time,

00:02:46.875 --> 00:02:49.502
she's going to keep studying for it

00:02:49.586 --> 00:02:51.504
all the way until she's forty

00:02:51.588 --> 00:02:52.881
since she's so stubborn!

00:02:52.964 --> 00:02:57.135
Please help our family
this one time. I beg of you.

00:02:57.927 --> 00:02:59.679
My goodness! Oh, no!

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.098
That wretched stray cat!

00:03:02.181 --> 00:03:04.434
My gosh! Oh, no! What am I going to do?

00:03:04.517 --> 00:03:05.351
Goodness.

00:03:06.603 --> 00:03:07.937
I swear…

00:03:10.982 --> 00:03:12.817
- Next, Jeong Min-su.
- Yes.

00:03:12.901 --> 00:03:13.818
And Lee Mi-jin.

00:03:13.902 --> 00:03:14.736
- Yes!
- Yes!

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:16.195
- Lee Mi-jin?
- Yes?

00:03:16.279 --> 00:03:17.196
- Yes?
- Come in.

00:03:19.073 --> 00:03:20.033
Lee Mi-jin?

00:03:20.116 --> 00:03:20.950
Yes.

00:03:21.451 --> 00:03:22.285
Please go ahead.

00:03:22.368 --> 00:03:24.662
I see you're both named Lee Mi-jin.

00:03:24.746 --> 00:03:26.080
Lee Mi-jin One, in her twenties.

00:03:26.164 --> 00:03:28.833
Lee Mi-jin Two, in her thirties.
Let's do it this way.

00:03:28.917 --> 00:03:30.543
I'm also in my twenties though.

00:03:31.628 --> 00:03:33.546
If you're 28, you're in your thirties.

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.089
Most apply in their twenties.

00:03:35.173 --> 00:03:37.175
Those in their thirties
or forties will be tough.

00:03:37.258 --> 00:03:40.220
I'm armed with maturity
and unlimited energy!

00:03:40.303 --> 00:03:43.723
I ranked the highest
on personality and physical tests.

00:03:43.806 --> 00:03:46.976
I'm the best in terms
of my strong will and effort as well!

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.977
Just a moment.

00:03:48.061 --> 00:03:49.604
- Lee Mi-jin One.
- Just sit.

00:03:49.687 --> 00:03:52.148
My MBTI is ENFP.

00:03:52.232 --> 00:03:54.776
My strength is that I'm bright
like a puppy.

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:57.195
I know I can do well!

00:03:57.278 --> 00:03:59.030
- I can do it!
- I can do it!

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:15.630 line:20%
WE REGRET TO INFORM YOU
THAT YOU WERE NOT SELECTED

00:04:17.173 --> 00:04:20.093
What am I going to tell my mom this time?

00:04:41.572 --> 00:04:42.824
I'm home.

00:04:42.907 --> 00:04:44.284
Mi-jin!

00:04:44.367 --> 00:04:45.576
- Yeah?
- Come here.

00:04:47.328 --> 00:04:48.913
Why didn't you tell me?

00:04:48.997 --> 00:04:49.831
Are you upset?

00:04:49.914 --> 00:04:51.082
Of course, I am!

00:04:51.165 --> 00:04:53.167
All right, dear. That's enough.

00:04:53.251 --> 00:04:54.711
This calls for a celebration.

00:04:55.837 --> 00:04:58.965
I called the environmental department.

00:04:59.048 --> 00:05:01.801
You should've told us
that you got the job!

00:05:01.884 --> 00:05:03.428
Why didn't you say anything?

00:05:04.304 --> 00:05:06.639
- I got the job? Me?
- Yeah!

00:05:07.515 --> 00:05:09.267
<i>I see you're both named Lee Mi-jin.</i>

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:10.810
Lee Mi-jin One, in her twenties.

00:05:10.893 --> 00:05:13.438
Lee Mi-jin Two, in her thirties.
Let's proceed this way.

00:05:15.231 --> 00:05:17.734
Mom, it's not what you think…

00:05:17.817 --> 00:05:19.360
I know I'm saying this in hindsight,

00:05:19.444 --> 00:05:21.070
but during that whole time

00:05:21.154 --> 00:05:24.991
while you were locked in your room
studying for civil service exams,

00:05:25.074 --> 00:05:27.618
it felt like rocks in my mind
weighing me down,

00:05:27.702 --> 00:05:31.205
and I couldn't comfortably eat anything
for even a day. Did you know?

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:33.374
What's the point of telling her that now?

00:05:33.458 --> 00:05:36.502
Because she got the job!
Imagine if she'd failed again!

00:05:36.586 --> 00:05:39.672
Do you really think I could say
what I just said to her?

00:05:39.756 --> 00:05:41.007
Anyway…

00:05:44.343 --> 00:05:46.888
Goodness, it's such a relief. I mean it.

00:05:46.971 --> 00:05:48.264
Isn't it?

00:05:48.347 --> 00:05:50.725
I was embarrassed
to show my face around town.

00:05:50.808 --> 00:05:53.019
Anyway, great job. Okay?

00:05:53.686 --> 00:05:54.729
My baby.

00:05:54.812 --> 00:05:56.647
At least you finally got a job.

00:05:57.857 --> 00:06:00.359
I can die in peace now.

00:06:02.737 --> 00:06:04.280
I'm so happy!

00:06:14.457 --> 00:06:16.042
Hi, dear!

00:06:16.125 --> 00:06:17.543
It's me.

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:20.254
You're the one who told me

00:06:20.338 --> 00:06:23.007
to call you first
when my daughter got a job.

00:06:24.842 --> 00:06:27.178
Yeah! She got the job.

00:06:27.887 --> 00:06:29.555
What? Seven years.

00:06:30.056 --> 00:06:31.808
After failing interviews for seven years,

00:06:31.891 --> 00:06:33.476
she made it in her eighth year!

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:35.561
Don't say all of that!

00:06:35.645 --> 00:06:37.271
What? Right.

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:21.315
Are you okay?

00:07:23.901 --> 00:07:25.027
Thank you.

00:07:25.111 --> 00:07:26.779
I think you hit your forehead…

00:07:31.868 --> 00:07:34.370
I thought about it a lot
before coming here.

00:07:34.454 --> 00:07:38.458
Things like this should be settled easily
so everything can be done at once.

00:07:38.541 --> 00:07:40.376
This really isn't a scam, right?

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:42.044
What do you take me for?

00:07:45.256 --> 00:07:46.757
Look into my eyes.

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:50.428
Do I look like a fraud
who'll bleed someone dry?

00:07:51.429 --> 00:07:54.515
Jeez, why are you dressed
like a court lady? I feel uncomfortable.

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:59.312
I had a gig as an extra.
There was a lady who was a no-show.

00:07:59.395 --> 00:08:00.563
I didn't have time to change.

00:08:01.314 --> 00:08:04.442
But if it were that easy
to get a government job,

00:08:04.525 --> 00:08:07.195
the eight years I spent studying
would feel like a waste.

00:08:08.154 --> 00:08:11.574
I don't give this chance to just anyone.

00:08:11.657 --> 00:08:13.910
Just one spot opened up
and I barely got it

00:08:13.993 --> 00:08:15.828
after begging for it.

00:08:15.912 --> 00:08:20.666
To be honest, I had no idea there was
a recommendation system in place.

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:22.001
Give me the documents first.

00:08:23.252 --> 00:08:26.339
I brought all of the documents
you asked me to prepare.

00:08:32.094 --> 00:08:34.847
These days, everyone's hired
through nepotism.

00:08:34.931 --> 00:08:37.225
That's why our poor
and innocent job seekers

00:08:37.308 --> 00:08:40.061
keep failing their interviews
after all their hard work.

00:08:41.979 --> 00:08:45.775
But… your fees seem rather high.

00:08:47.026 --> 00:08:48.945
Couldn't you give me a small discount?

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:52.573
A big discount is great,
but a small one's okay too.

00:08:53.366 --> 00:08:55.618
Are you trying to haggle
like we're at a marketplace?

00:08:55.701 --> 00:08:56.577
Come on.

00:08:56.661 --> 00:08:59.914
Just spend your life job seeking
until you're old and tired then.

00:08:59.997 --> 00:09:01.541
No.

00:09:01.624 --> 00:09:03.376
I'll pay it.

00:09:04.669 --> 00:09:05.878
It's expensive. Don't touch.

00:09:08.714 --> 00:09:10.967
Be ready. I hit the jackpot today.

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:13.970
I'll buy you something good.
Tell me what you want to eat.

00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:17.890
Goodness, I am so sorry.

00:09:18.599 --> 00:09:21.394
Excuse me, but may I use
your phone to make a call?

00:09:21.477 --> 00:09:23.396
I have to meet someone,
but I lost my phone.

00:09:23.479 --> 00:09:25.064
I'd really appreciate it.

00:09:25.147 --> 00:09:26.315
Make it quick then.

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:27.733
Okay, thank you.

00:09:33.906 --> 00:09:35.032
Hey, it's me.

00:09:35.992 --> 00:09:36.993
Yeah, it's not my number.

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:39.745
Some idiot stole my phone.

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:42.290
No, it's fine.

00:09:43.541 --> 00:09:45.334
Track this phone's location and details.

00:09:48.087 --> 00:09:49.839
Here you go. Thank you.

00:09:51.424 --> 00:09:54.218
Goodness.
Some idiot must've stolen your phone.

00:09:54.302 --> 00:09:56.470
I know. The world's full of crooks.

00:09:56.554 --> 00:09:59.056
The world's a terrible place these days.

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:00.308
You have to be careful.

00:10:03.436 --> 00:10:04.687
Did you make the deposit?

00:10:05.187 --> 00:10:06.856
My limit's only five million won.

00:10:06.939 --> 00:10:08.983
Can I send you the rest tomorrow?

00:10:09.066 --> 00:10:11.569
I can't do business with you
if you keep this up.

00:10:11.652 --> 00:10:13.696
I might not be able to continue.

00:10:13.779 --> 00:10:15.573
I'll go and get it
from the bank right now.

00:10:15.656 --> 00:10:18.451
<i>That's a burner phone.</i>
<i>I tracked its location just in case.</i>

00:10:19.327 --> 00:10:20.328
Go quickly.

00:10:23.623 --> 00:10:25.207
Thank you for earlier. Here you go.

00:10:27.043 --> 00:10:28.044
You didn't have to.

00:10:28.127 --> 00:10:28.961
Thank you.

00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:31.130
That's hot!

00:10:31.213 --> 00:10:32.214
Wait, it's not hot.

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:33.674
Damn it.

00:10:33.758 --> 00:10:35.426
- Sorry.
- My wallet can't get wet.

00:10:35.509 --> 00:10:36.719
- Give it here.
- Damn it!

00:10:36.802 --> 00:10:38.262
- Use these napkins.
- Jeez.

00:10:38.346 --> 00:10:39.930
Yeah, can you run a background check?

00:10:40.014 --> 00:10:41.807
The name's "Choi Geun-ju."

00:10:41.891 --> 00:10:44.018
Resident registration number is 891017.

00:10:44.101 --> 00:10:45.853
- And 112…
- Are you insane?

00:10:47.938 --> 00:10:48.939
Damn it!

00:10:53.235 --> 00:10:54.362
What's going on?

00:10:54.445 --> 00:10:56.197
Can't you tell? He's a scammer.

00:11:01.702 --> 00:11:03.871
Hey! You bastard!

00:11:08.751 --> 00:11:10.252
Hey, you jerk!

00:11:18.135 --> 00:11:19.595
Who the hell are you?

00:11:44.328 --> 00:11:47.039
Damn, he was on me like a leech!
He was so tall though.

00:11:53.462 --> 00:11:55.548
Hey, you scammer!

00:11:55.631 --> 00:11:57.800
There you are, you fraud! Hey!

00:11:57.883 --> 00:11:59.176
Give back my money! Hey!

00:11:59.885 --> 00:12:01.637
- I'm sorry!
- Hey, wait…

00:12:02.513 --> 00:12:03.347
Hey!

00:12:04.014 --> 00:12:05.808
Stop right there!

00:12:05.891 --> 00:12:07.184
Stop, you jerk!

00:12:12.231 --> 00:12:13.274
Are you okay?

00:12:13.858 --> 00:12:15.359
It's dangerous, so don't follow.

00:12:16.902 --> 00:12:18.446
What in the world?

00:12:20.531 --> 00:12:21.907
Mr. Gye?

00:12:29.832 --> 00:12:31.375
Let go of me!

00:12:31.459 --> 00:12:35.004
You could find a decent job if you want,
but you leech off others instead?

00:12:35.087 --> 00:12:36.297
Who are you? Are you a cop?

00:12:37.256 --> 00:12:38.340
I'm the cop, punk!

00:12:39.091 --> 00:12:40.426
Who is this punk?

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:42.845
He scams job seekers.

00:12:42.928 --> 00:12:44.263
I caught him at the scene,

00:12:44.346 --> 00:12:45.598
you can take him in now.

00:12:45.681 --> 00:12:48.767
Wow, you caught him within ten minutes?

00:12:48.851 --> 00:12:50.144
Get up, punk.

00:12:52.521 --> 00:12:54.857
Hey! You bastard!

00:12:55.941 --> 00:12:58.110
Hey!

00:12:58.194 --> 00:12:59.612
- Give me my money!
- What is this?

00:12:59.695 --> 00:13:00.863
- Give it!
- What are you doing?

00:13:00.946 --> 00:13:03.324
Give me back my money!

00:13:03.407 --> 00:13:05.159
That's enough. You can't do this.

00:13:05.242 --> 00:13:06.744
- My money!
- You can't do this!

00:13:08.454 --> 00:13:10.164
You rotten punk.

00:13:10.247 --> 00:13:12.416
You had nothing better to do
than steal pennies?

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:13.667
Don't hit me!

00:13:21.509 --> 00:13:22.801
I can't go home like this.

00:13:23.761 --> 00:13:27.056
That money was from my mom's shop.

00:13:28.516 --> 00:13:30.726
Mom…

00:13:33.395 --> 00:13:34.980
I'll escort her to the station.

00:13:35.064 --> 00:13:37.900
She could get emotional again
while riding with the perpetrator.

00:13:37.983 --> 00:13:40.611
He's the type who'd say
both parties were at fault.

00:13:40.694 --> 00:13:42.696
Okay. We have to question the victim.

00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:45.241
- Please do it as quickly as you can.
- Okay.

00:14:15.729 --> 00:14:17.273
Excuse me, ma'am?

00:14:18.732 --> 00:14:19.733
I was looking for you.

00:14:20.818 --> 00:14:22.861
Thank you for earlier.

00:14:23.571 --> 00:14:24.780
Put these on first.

00:14:26.699 --> 00:14:28.409
No, it's fine. I'm okay.

00:14:28.492 --> 00:14:30.286
The witness interview takes a long time.

00:14:30.369 --> 00:14:32.872
The station's floor is cold. Put them on.

00:14:32.955 --> 00:14:34.290
Thank you.

00:14:34.373 --> 00:14:35.749
Also, we'll take my car.

00:14:35.833 --> 00:14:37.585
No, I can take the bus.

00:14:37.668 --> 00:14:39.503
Your bag and things are in my car.

00:14:39.587 --> 00:14:40.671
Put those shoes on first.

00:15:15.581 --> 00:15:17.833
- Put your seatbelt on.
- Okay.

00:15:22.338 --> 00:15:24.548
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.

00:15:24.632 --> 00:15:27.176
- I'm sorry.
- No, that's okay.

00:15:30.095 --> 00:15:32.431
<i>Why is this man so friendly?</i>

00:15:33.599 --> 00:15:35.184
<i>Is he trying to scam me too?</i>

00:15:35.809 --> 00:15:37.186
Thank you for the ride.

00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:40.689
I don't normally meddle
in other people's business, but…

00:15:41.357 --> 00:15:42.483
<i>But?</i>

00:15:42.566 --> 00:15:44.777
I guess I felt a sense of responsibility.

00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:46.904
<i>What responsibility?</i>

00:15:46.987 --> 00:15:49.156
I'm just saying
there's no need to thank me.

00:15:50.199 --> 00:15:51.033
Okay.

00:15:52.534 --> 00:15:54.828
But how did you meet that fraud?

00:15:56.121 --> 00:15:57.122
Well…

00:15:58.374 --> 00:15:59.917
It's kind of embarrassing to say.

00:16:06.924 --> 00:16:10.427
I'm sorry,
but this is all I have right now.

00:16:11.887 --> 00:16:14.473
- It's fine.
- Thank you for everything.

00:16:14.556 --> 00:16:15.599
It's fine--

00:16:17.267 --> 00:16:18.727
It's really okay…

00:16:22.564 --> 00:16:25.192
She seems so normal.
How did she fall victim to that fraud?

00:16:39.999 --> 00:16:42.334
Wow, you're pretty brave.

00:16:42.418 --> 00:16:44.586
You came up with a scam
at civil service exams?

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:46.255
If you want to dig a well,

00:16:46.338 --> 00:16:48.132
you have to go somewhere
with thirsty people

00:16:48.215 --> 00:16:51.468
to increase your chances of success,
and that's just how it works.

00:16:51.552 --> 00:16:53.137
- You punk.
- Sir, that's illegal.

00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:55.097
You should shove his face into that bowl.

00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:56.724
This is a police station, you punk.

00:16:56.807 --> 00:16:58.517
- Goodness.
- Detective?

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:01.687
But when do you think
I can get my money back?

00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:04.565
Well, it was deposited
into a voice phishing account.

00:17:04.648 --> 00:17:06.108
You can't get it right away.

00:17:06.191 --> 00:17:07.192
What?

00:17:08.444 --> 00:17:09.570
No.

00:17:10.612 --> 00:17:12.364
I need that money now.

00:17:12.448 --> 00:17:13.615
Wait…

00:17:13.699 --> 00:17:16.744
Did you bring emergency funds
to give to the scammer?

00:17:16.827 --> 00:17:17.828
Well…

00:17:19.913 --> 00:17:21.665
- That bastard…
- Wait!

00:17:21.749 --> 00:17:23.459
- Give me my money!
- What are you doing?

00:17:23.542 --> 00:17:25.294
- Now, now.
- Why are you eating?

00:17:25.878 --> 00:17:27.796
Calm down, okay?

00:17:28.797 --> 00:17:30.174
But he…

00:17:33.093 --> 00:17:34.678
He said if I paid the fee,

00:17:35.596 --> 00:17:36.847
I'd get the job.

00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:38.974
- Okay.
- I could get a loan for civil servants.

00:17:39.058 --> 00:17:41.351
And he said I could
get my money back right away.

00:17:42.144 --> 00:17:43.145
So?

00:17:47.483 --> 00:17:48.609
I gave him my bankbook too.

00:17:48.692 --> 00:17:49.693
What?

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:52.654
I gave him my bankbook.

00:17:52.738 --> 00:17:54.364
- You gave him your bankbook?
- Goodness!

00:17:54.448 --> 00:17:56.241
- Good grief, ma'am!
- My gosh!

00:17:56.325 --> 00:17:57.743
I'm not that old!

00:17:59.078 --> 00:18:01.955
Sir, I'll look into his fake accounts too.

00:18:02.039 --> 00:18:02.873
All right.

00:18:02.956 --> 00:18:06.001
Did I do something wrong again?

00:18:06.085 --> 00:18:08.837
If this ends up being connected
to a phishing case,

00:18:08.921 --> 00:18:12.841
the victim can become
the perpetrator in a heartbeat!

00:18:12.925 --> 00:18:14.676
But I'm the victim.

00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:15.928
I know that!

00:18:27.106 --> 00:18:28.357

<i>Your personal information has been leaked.</i>
<i>Check the balance of your bank account--</i>

Excuse me. I'm in no position
to take a call like this right now.

00:20:00.574 --> 00:20:02.576
<i>Then, if you send</i>
<i>your public key certificate--</i>

Listen,

00:20:04.328 --> 00:20:07.247
I only have 1,500 won

<i>Don't be like that.</i>
<i>Before the funds are withdrawn--</i>

You don't seem to get it

00:20:12.753 --> 00:20:16.798
I'm in no mood for this kind of call,
you damn fraud!

00:20:16.882 --> 00:20:18.342
You think I'm stupid?

00:20:18.425 --> 00:20:21.428

<i>- Hey--</i>
- Is he out of his mind?

00:20:44.201 --> 00:20:45.619
Is it you again? The prosecutor?

00:20:47.204 --> 00:20:48.914
- How did you know?
- I warned you.

00:20:48.997 --> 00:20:50.874
I said I'm in no mood for it today.

00:20:51.458 --> 00:20:54.002
I understand you're upset

- But why the rude words…
<i>- You understand?</i>

If you understand,
then how did you get my number?

It seems your personal information

00:21:02.469 --> 00:21:04.304
accidentally fell into my hands.

00:21:04.388 --> 00:21:05.764
"Accidentally"?

Hey, you crazy psycho!
You're worse than a rabid dog!

00:21:08.642 --> 00:21:10.143
I can't believe what you're saying.

Who do you think you are
to call me back like this?

00:21:14.147 --> 00:21:16.733
Are you insane? You said you were
Jang Chen earlier, right?

SOUNDS OF CALMING RAIN AT DAWN

<i>Daeho-ri in Seohan City…</i>

00:23:17.687 --> 00:23:19.189
It's a very strange place.

00:23:20.482 --> 00:23:22.067
Twenty years ago,

00:23:22.150 --> 00:23:23.860
a lot of women went missing.

00:23:25.487 --> 00:23:29.658
There was a witness connected
to the disappearances, but they died.

00:23:31.326 --> 00:23:33.703
<i>Things settled down after that.</i>

00:23:34.996 --> 00:23:38.125
But it's hard to investigate
when an adult goes missing.

00:23:41.670 --> 00:23:42.838
<i>Where do you think</i>

00:23:44.548 --> 00:23:46.216
<i>all of those missing people went?</i>

00:24:07.028 --> 00:24:08.780
It's a cat.

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:11.491
Hi.

00:24:12.993 --> 00:24:14.286
Why aren't you running away?

00:24:16.621 --> 00:24:18.165
It's really not running away.

00:24:22.210 --> 00:24:23.461

I got this from my gig today.

00:24:35.307 --> 00:24:37.017
I think you can drink this.

00:24:37.684 --> 00:24:38.810
Here, drink it.

00:24:42.564 --> 00:24:44.482
You don't have anywhere to go either?

00:24:48.278 --> 00:24:49.404
Same here.

00:24:51.239 --> 00:24:52.949

00:24:54.659 --> 00:24:56.786
no one's looking for me.

00:25:00.916 --> 00:25:01.917

You look just like this cat I know.

00:25:13.345 --> 00:25:15.138
Instead of a broke job seeker like me,

00:25:15.222 --> 00:25:17.349
make sure you find a rich owner

00:25:17.432 --> 00:25:20.727
who gets paid well
and feeds you nice organic food.

00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:21.728

00:25:22.437 --> 00:25:24.147
Here, drink this.

00:25:24.981 --> 00:25:25.857
Good.

00:25:30.362 --> 00:25:32.822
I can't pet you
since I have milk in my hand.

00:25:33.698 --> 00:25:36.493
<i>Fine dust is in full swing</i>

00:25:36.576 --> 00:25:39.704
<i>in the central region, including Seoul.</i>

00:25:39.788 --> 00:25:42.832
<i>The government has issued</i>
<i>a fine dust warning across the nation.</i>

00:25:43.458 --> 00:25:44.584
I'm home.

00:25:44.668 --> 00:25:46.628
Hey. Welcome home, Mi-jin!

00:25:46.711 --> 00:25:48.630
<i>It will decrease.</i>

00:25:48.713 --> 00:25:50.465
<i>But instead of better air quality…</i>

00:25:50.548 --> 00:25:52.092
Why are you dressed like that?

00:25:52.968 --> 00:25:54.594
Why are you wearing that?

00:25:54.678 --> 00:25:55.971
I told you I had a gig.

00:25:58.056 --> 00:26:01.559
A maiden ghost yesterday
and a middle-aged court lady today.

00:26:01.643 --> 00:26:03.728
It's not like you get paid
that much though.

00:26:03.812 --> 00:26:06.690
Is that why you were too busy
to answer your phone today?

00:26:06.773 --> 00:26:07.816
Did you call?

00:26:08.984 --> 00:26:10.568
My phone's out of battery.

00:26:10.652 --> 00:26:12.404
I almost forgot. Mi-jin.

00:26:12.487 --> 00:26:15.031
Did you make the payment
for the goods the other day?

00:26:15.115 --> 00:26:16.825
Did you pay the wrong person?

00:26:18.785 --> 00:26:19.911
I made the payment.

00:26:19.995 --> 00:26:21.121
Right?

00:26:21.204 --> 00:26:24.666
Jeez. But why did say they didn't get it?

00:26:24.749 --> 00:26:27.043
- Why the fuss?
<i>- This happened in the city today.</i>

00:26:27.127 --> 00:26:29.421
<i>An absurd incident</i>
<i>occurred today in Seohan City,</i>

00:26:29.504 --> 00:26:32.590
<i>where a job fraud victim</i>
<i>had their personal information leaked</i>

00:26:32.674 --> 00:26:34.384
<i>and was framed for voice phishing.</i>

00:26:34.467 --> 00:26:35.552
<i>Here's a video we received.</i>

00:26:37.512 --> 00:26:38.430
My goodness.

00:26:38.513 --> 00:26:40.682
Dad, where's the remote? Where is it?

00:26:40.765 --> 00:26:41.891
- You scared me.
- The remote.

00:26:42.517 --> 00:26:43.893
What is it?

00:26:43.977 --> 00:26:45.937
But I was watching the news.

00:26:46.021 --> 00:26:47.439
- What's wrong with you?
- Well…

00:26:48.189 --> 00:26:49.649
It's just that…

00:26:50.233 --> 00:26:51.484
Your Majesty.

00:26:52.068 --> 00:26:56.239
Your Majesty,
I ask for your understanding.

00:26:56.323 --> 00:26:57.324
What are you doing?

00:26:57.407 --> 00:26:59.326
Go and take a shower!

00:26:59.993 --> 00:27:02.662
I bought some hanger steak

00:27:02.746 --> 00:27:04.331
just for you tonight.

00:27:04.414 --> 00:27:06.666
- Okay?
- You're a butcher's daughter.

00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:09.252
But you always complained
you never had any Hanwoo to eat.

00:27:09.336 --> 00:27:13.673
You begged
for premium grade <i>Hanwoo </i>every day.

00:27:14.424 --> 00:27:17.677
You're the one who said
you couldn't even waste pork on me either.

00:27:17.761 --> 00:27:19.304
That was a long time ago.

00:27:19.971 --> 00:27:23.641
A jobless bum can't compare
to a respectable office worker.

00:27:24.351 --> 00:27:27.729
Forget it. I don't need it.
Someone like me should starve.

00:27:27.812 --> 00:27:29.272
What? Are you on a diet?

00:27:31.524 --> 00:27:34.569
I just want to go to bed early tonight.

00:27:36.613 --> 00:27:37.947
What's wrong with you?

00:27:38.031 --> 00:27:39.199
Leave her be.

00:27:39.282 --> 00:27:42.285
She finally got a job
after seven years of studying.

00:27:42.369 --> 00:27:43.703
She must be exhausted.

00:27:43.787 --> 00:27:45.747
She looks so lethargic.

00:27:46.915 --> 00:27:48.833
Should I make some ox knee soup for her?

00:28:16.194 --> 00:28:17.737
I'll eat dinner later.

00:28:25.245 --> 00:28:26.579
What's this?

00:28:26.663 --> 00:28:28.832
DEAR DAUGHTER, WEAR THESE
ON YOUR FIRST DAY TO WORK

00:28:40.802 --> 00:28:41.761
Jeez.

00:28:44.013 --> 00:28:45.181
Mom!

00:28:45.265 --> 00:28:46.641
Who told you to buy me shoes?

00:28:46.725 --> 00:28:48.977
Why do you keep doing things
out of character?

00:28:50.979 --> 00:28:52.647
I bought you those.

00:28:52.731 --> 00:28:55.191
I didn't ask you to buy me shoes, Dad.

00:28:55.275 --> 00:28:58.695
You barely have any pocket money.
Who said I needed them?

00:29:02.157 --> 00:29:04.159
What's the matter with that girl?

00:29:04.951 --> 00:29:06.411
Come on out, you brat!

00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:10.665
You're proud of barely being able
to get a job after seven years?

00:29:11.332 --> 00:29:12.792
Stop being so arrogant!

00:29:16.254 --> 00:29:17.422
LEE MI-JIN, TEST PREP
KOREAN

00:29:21.092 --> 00:29:23.094
Why are you tossing those out?

00:29:23.595 --> 00:29:25.930
You could get money for those
from a used bookstore!

00:29:26.598 --> 00:29:28.183
That foolish girl!

<i>It's the meaning behind the humble name</i>

<i>Even though I experienced failure</i>

There was never a day

RÉSUMÉ
NAME: LEE MI-JIN

00:33:17.370 --> 00:33:18.204
There it is.

00:33:18.287 --> 00:33:20.206
Mr. Kim!

00:33:21.207 --> 00:33:23.876
Mr. Kim <i>Soju</i>!

00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:25.753
It's our fourth time meeting.

00:33:27.255 --> 00:33:29.507
Now, let's drink!

00:33:30.216 --> 00:33:32.301
All right, let's drink!

00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:44.814
What?

00:33:45.356 --> 00:33:47.233
Hey. You.

00:33:48.901 --> 00:33:50.737
Aren't you the cat I met earlier?

00:33:52.030 --> 00:33:53.448
Do you like me?

00:33:54.115 --> 00:33:57.994
Or do I look pathetic to you too?

00:34:00.038 --> 00:34:03.583
Thanks for staying by my side.

00:34:05.752 --> 00:34:08.087
Thanks. Hey. Damn.

00:34:09.589 --> 00:34:13.009
What? You just said you liked me.

00:34:14.302 --> 00:34:16.471
Jeez, you scared me! Hey!

00:34:18.014 --> 00:34:19.891
Don't go in there! Hey!

00:34:24.604 --> 00:34:25.813
<i>I wish…</i>

00:34:26.731 --> 00:34:28.858
<i>I could just disappear like this…</i>

00:34:30.735 --> 00:34:31.944
<i>without anyone knowing.</i>

00:34:33.237 --> 00:34:34.072
<i>Or…</i>

00:34:35.573 --> 00:34:38.117
<i>I wish I could be someone else.</i>

00:35:09.774 --> 00:35:11.943
<i>What's wrong with my body?</i>

00:35:13.319 --> 00:35:14.987
<i>Did I catch a cold from the rain?</i>

00:35:16.989 --> 00:35:18.991
<i>It doesn't feel like the flu.</i>

00:35:22.286 --> 00:35:24.247
<i>My body aches so much.</i>

00:35:35.925 --> 00:35:38.219
<i>You must've had</i>
<i>a lot of stress while raising kids.</i>

00:35:40.388 --> 00:35:41.347
<i>A lot of stress!</i>

00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:43.683
I feel so nauseous.

00:35:43.766 --> 00:35:45.101
When did I come in last night?

00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:54.485
- Honey, another cucumber.
- Okay.

00:35:57.738 --> 00:35:59.031
Dad.

00:35:59.115 --> 00:36:01.075
I feel really weird.

00:36:01.159 --> 00:36:04.787
Gosh. Your body is tensing up
now that you have to go to work.

00:36:05.413 --> 00:36:06.330
Mi-jin.

00:36:06.956 --> 00:36:09.917
- Can you scratch my back?
- Just take a shower.

00:36:10.001 --> 00:36:11.878
- Jeez. Here?
- No, next to it.

00:36:12.378 --> 00:36:14.755
- Here?
- A little lower.

00:36:14.839 --> 00:36:15.715
Right there.

00:36:16.299 --> 00:36:20.052
But I do feel really weird, Dad.

00:36:20.136 --> 00:36:23.139
It feels heavy, and I'm aching all over.

00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:25.683
- Is it the hangover?
- That's good.

00:36:26.726 --> 00:36:28.644
- That's good.
- Did you have hairtail?

00:36:28.728 --> 00:36:30.354
That feels so good.

00:36:30.897 --> 00:36:32.398
It feels so nice.

00:36:32.481 --> 00:36:33.608
What are you doing?

00:36:34.108 --> 00:36:35.026
What do you think?

00:36:35.943 --> 00:36:37.528
- What in the world?
- What's with you?

00:36:37.612 --> 00:36:40.114
- What is this?
- What's going on between you two?

00:36:40.198 --> 00:36:41.115
What are you saying?

00:36:41.199 --> 00:36:42.575
I don't know this lady!

00:36:42.658 --> 00:36:44.869
Who are you? Why are you in our house?

00:36:44.952 --> 00:36:46.495
- Who are you?
- Jeez.

00:36:47.038 --> 00:36:48.623
What's wrong with you two?

00:36:48.706 --> 00:36:50.166
- Mi-jin!
- What?

00:36:51.751 --> 00:36:53.753
- Mi-jin!
- What?

00:36:55.671 --> 00:36:57.548
- Mi-jin!
- What's wrong with you?

00:36:57.632 --> 00:36:58.549
Where's Mi-jin?

00:36:58.633 --> 00:37:01.344
- You really don't know her?
- I told you I don't!

00:37:01.427 --> 00:37:03.221
- Who is this lady?
- What's with you?

00:37:03.304 --> 00:37:05.431
I said I'm feeling awful.

00:37:06.557 --> 00:37:07.892
Mom, where's the medicine?

00:37:09.393 --> 00:37:10.478
What is with you two?

00:37:11.020 --> 00:37:12.230
- Call the cops!
- Okay!

00:37:13.522 --> 00:37:15.149
Where did I have it wrapped up?

00:37:15.233 --> 00:37:17.068
- Leave while I'm being nice.
- What?

00:37:17.151 --> 00:37:19.237
- Get out.
- Seriously! Stop it!

00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:20.738
- Lee Mi-jin!
- What?

00:37:20.821 --> 00:37:22.531
Who are you, lady?

00:37:23.115 --> 00:37:25.660
Why are you being like this?
I'm right here!

00:37:25.743 --> 00:37:26.661
Mom.

00:37:27.620 --> 00:37:28.996
<i>- This is the police.</i>
- Dad--

00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:31.374
Hello! This is 44 Daeho-ri!

00:37:31.457 --> 00:37:32.291
Yes, that's it.

00:37:32.375 --> 00:37:34.961
A strange person has broken into our home!

00:37:35.044 --> 00:37:37.505
Yes, it's some old lady.
She's a total stranger!

00:37:37.588 --> 00:37:38.839
Why are you doing this?

00:37:38.923 --> 00:37:40.508
Is it because of yesterday?

00:37:40.591 --> 00:37:42.051
I'll tell you everything!

00:37:42.802 --> 00:37:44.428
- Mom!
- Please come quickly!

00:37:44.512 --> 00:37:45.513
- Dad!
- Don't!

00:37:45.596 --> 00:37:47.223
What's with you two?

00:37:47.306 --> 00:37:48.516
- Seriously!
- Just go!

00:37:49.141 --> 00:37:50.142
- Just go!
- Mom!

00:37:50.226 --> 00:37:51.686
Get out right now!

00:37:51.769 --> 00:37:53.145
What's with you? Snap out of it!

00:37:53.229 --> 00:37:54.563
- Get out!
- Please come now!

00:37:54.647 --> 00:37:56.023
Why are you doing this?

00:37:56.107 --> 00:37:57.566
Please leave, lady!

00:37:57.650 --> 00:37:58.776
Get out, lady!

00:37:58.859 --> 00:38:00.278
- Mi-jin!
- What?

00:38:00.361 --> 00:38:01.904
- Get out!
- Dad!

00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:06.867
They've gone insane!

00:38:08.327 --> 00:38:09.537
What's with them?

00:38:15.001 --> 00:38:16.585
Move out of the way!

00:38:16.669 --> 00:38:17.503
Move!

00:38:18.671 --> 00:38:20.298
Sir, are you okay?

00:38:20.381 --> 00:38:21.757
- Do I look okay?
- I'm sorry!

00:38:21.841 --> 00:38:23.467
Watch where you're going!

00:38:24.051 --> 00:38:24.969
Damn it!

00:38:25.052 --> 00:38:27.763
Hey, lady! Get it together, will you?

00:38:29.098 --> 00:38:32.935
I know I don't have makeup on,
but I'm not old enough to be called that.

00:38:46.741 --> 00:38:47.575
What's this?

00:38:48.409 --> 00:38:49.744
What is this?

00:38:53.205 --> 00:38:54.540
What's wrong with my face?

00:38:57.501 --> 00:38:58.836
What's going on?

00:38:58.919 --> 00:39:00.796
You better call your insurance!

00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:02.298
- Come fix this!
- What is this belly?

00:39:02.381 --> 00:39:03.924
Hey! You!

00:39:04.008 --> 00:39:05.426
Where are you going?

00:39:05.509 --> 00:39:07.303
It's the cops!

00:39:07.386 --> 00:39:09.096
Officer, there's been an accident!

00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:11.724
Over here! Someone call my insurance!

00:39:11.807 --> 00:39:12.683
Ma'am, hold on!

00:39:12.767 --> 00:39:14.435
Don't move, ma'am!

00:39:14.518 --> 00:39:16.145
- Just wait.
- Mom, calm down.

00:39:16.228 --> 00:39:17.938
- Stop calling me that!
- It's me, Mi-jin!

00:39:18.022 --> 00:39:19.774
- I'm not your mom!
- Over here!

00:39:19.857 --> 00:39:21.067
Over here!

00:39:21.150 --> 00:39:22.234
- Officer!
- What is it?

00:39:22.318 --> 00:39:23.152
I'm their daughter.

00:39:23.235 --> 00:39:25.529
No, she's not! She's not our daughter!

00:39:26.822 --> 00:39:28.824
She keeps calling me "Mom," but I'm not!

00:39:28.908 --> 00:39:30.117
This is insane!

00:39:30.826 --> 00:39:32.244
I'm your daughter!

00:39:33.204 --> 00:39:34.622
I got this belly overnight!

00:39:35.414 --> 00:39:37.583
Our daughter doesn't have a potbelly!

00:39:38.626 --> 00:39:41.045
Who are you?

00:39:43.047 --> 00:39:45.674 line:20%
Excuse me, ma'am. What is your name?

00:39:48.552 --> 00:39:49.845
I'm Lee Mi-jin.

00:39:49.929 --> 00:39:52.765
- My gosh.
- And your resident registration number?

00:39:53.766 --> 00:39:54.767
It's 960316…

00:39:54.850 --> 00:39:55.726
- Nine…
- 2651--

00:39:55.810 --> 00:39:57.353
What? Born in 1996?

00:39:58.771 --> 00:40:02.233
Seriously, why are you doing this?

00:40:02.316 --> 00:40:04.402
She totally planned this.

00:40:04.485 --> 00:40:07.196
You look normal on the outside,
but you broke into our house.

00:40:07.279 --> 00:40:08.781
And you're posing as my daughter!

00:40:08.864 --> 00:40:10.491
- Mom!
- My gosh!

00:40:10.574 --> 00:40:13.160
- I'm not a stranger! I'm Mi-jin!
- Officer!

00:40:13.994 --> 00:40:15.079
I said I'm Mi-jin!

00:40:16.038 --> 00:40:17.915
This is ridiculous!

00:40:17.998 --> 00:40:18.833
Take a seat.

00:40:18.916 --> 00:40:20.167
- Take a seat.
- Mom!

00:40:20.251 --> 00:40:22.503
Your birthday is June 13
and blood type is B.

00:40:22.586 --> 00:40:24.422
And you have a wart on your butt.

00:40:25.339 --> 00:40:27.383
Dad, you gave me your emergency funds!

00:40:27.925 --> 00:40:29.051
Jeez!

00:40:29.135 --> 00:40:31.220
This is crazy!

00:40:31.762 --> 00:40:33.264
Did you tell her?

00:40:33.347 --> 00:40:35.891
What's wrong with you? It wasn't me!

00:40:35.975 --> 00:40:38.978
Then, how does she know
about the wart on my butt?

00:40:39.061 --> 00:40:39.895
Ma'am.

00:40:39.979 --> 00:40:43.315
Seriously, who are you?
Do you have something against our family?

00:40:43.399 --> 00:40:45.734
I'm really Mi-jin!

00:40:46.735 --> 00:40:48.320
I really am Mi-jin!

00:40:48.404 --> 00:40:49.822
Sit down! Just sit!

00:40:49.905 --> 00:40:52.324
Why would you go
into someone else's house?

00:40:52.408 --> 00:40:54.493
Sir, how old do I look to you?

00:40:54.577 --> 00:40:57.538
Seriously, I was born in 1996.

00:40:58.998 --> 00:41:00.458
My goodness!

00:41:00.541 --> 00:41:01.375
Unbelievable.

00:41:01.459 --> 00:41:02.376
That's right!

00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:03.419
My ID!

00:41:03.502 --> 00:41:06.213
Here. Look at this. We're the same, right?

00:41:06.297 --> 00:41:07.381
- Honey.
- If you look…

00:41:07.465 --> 00:41:08.841
- That's Mi-jin's wallet!
- Right?

00:41:08.924 --> 00:41:10.342
- Hey! Her wallet!
- Hey!

00:41:12.261 --> 00:41:15.598
She stole her clothes too!
She totally planned this!

00:41:15.681 --> 00:41:17.433
Come here right now.

00:41:17.975 --> 00:41:18.934
- Come here!
- Honey!

00:41:20.102 --> 00:41:22.396
- Where's Mi-jin?
- Calm down.

00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:23.981
I feel like I'm insane.

00:41:24.482 --> 00:41:27.234
When I woke up,

00:41:27.318 --> 00:41:29.320
I looked old like this.

00:41:29.403 --> 00:41:30.321
I see.

00:41:30.404 --> 00:41:32.907
Is this a dream? It's not, right?

00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:33.824
Right?

00:41:36.952 --> 00:41:38.287
Are there hidden cameras?

00:41:38.370 --> 00:41:39.663
She must be crazy!

00:41:42.666 --> 00:41:44.335
I really was born in 1996!

00:41:45.419 --> 00:41:47.046
I'm going to lose my mind!

00:41:47.713 --> 00:41:49.673
I was born in 1996!

00:41:50.382 --> 00:41:51.592
This is insane!

00:41:51.675 --> 00:41:52.760
How did this happen?

00:42:02.394 --> 00:42:04.480
I don't think she's in her right mind.

00:42:05.064 --> 00:42:08.192
She doesn't have a guardian,
and she doesn't know her own name.

00:42:10.402 --> 00:42:11.403
Is it dementia?

00:42:16.075 --> 00:42:17.785
This makes no damn sense.

00:42:19.411 --> 00:42:20.746
This is my face?

00:42:23.457 --> 00:42:24.542
This is crazy.

00:42:25.376 --> 00:42:27.086
I think I'm crazy.

00:42:27.795 --> 00:42:28.629
What do I do?

00:42:28.712 --> 00:42:30.005
Excuse me?

00:42:31.382 --> 00:42:33.425
- Did you really age overnight?
- Yes, sir.

00:42:34.385 --> 00:42:36.470
Instead of being here like this,

00:42:36.554 --> 00:42:38.847
shouldn't you go to a lab somewhere?

00:42:38.931 --> 00:42:41.642
Or tell your story to that show,
<i>Unanswered Questions?</i>

00:42:41.725 --> 00:42:43.060
Wait a second.

00:42:43.143 --> 00:42:45.271
- I know one of the producers.
- No, it's fine.

00:42:45.354 --> 00:42:46.730
Just wait. It's okay.

00:42:46.814 --> 00:42:48.524
- No, later--
- It's okay.

00:42:48.607 --> 00:42:49.775
A lab?

00:42:51.443 --> 00:42:52.278
By the way,

00:42:53.028 --> 00:42:54.280
I keep looking at her,

00:42:54.363 --> 00:42:56.198
and she does look familiar.

00:42:56.949 --> 00:42:58.617
It's like I've seen her before.

00:42:58.701 --> 00:43:00.869
- Where?
- I think she's unwell.

00:43:01.662 --> 00:43:03.330
We'll take care of this.

00:43:03.414 --> 00:43:04.999
- We'll reprimand her too.
- Okay.

00:43:06.917 --> 00:43:08.335
I feel bad for her.

00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:14.675
By the way, can't you scan
her fingerprints and find out who she is?

00:43:14.758 --> 00:43:16.885
Actually, we're going to scan them

00:43:16.969 --> 00:43:18.762
and find her place of residence…

00:43:19.597 --> 00:43:21.515
What? Where did she go?

00:43:21.599 --> 00:43:22.433
Where is she?

00:43:22.516 --> 00:43:24.560
- Hey! Where'd the lady go?
- Where is she?

00:43:24.643 --> 00:43:25.603
My goodness!

00:43:25.686 --> 00:43:28.314
She got away! What do we do?

00:43:29.732 --> 00:43:32.192
Lady, don't come near me again! Move!

00:43:32.276 --> 00:43:34.153
Move! Damn it!

00:43:35.904 --> 00:43:38.282
- I'm sorry, sir. I'm sorry.
- Damn it!

00:43:38.365 --> 00:43:40.326
- Seriously, are you insane?
- I'm sorry.

00:43:40.409 --> 00:43:42.828
- Ma'am, where are you going?
- Twice in one day!

00:43:44.413 --> 00:43:45.372 line:20%
Damn it!

00:43:45.456 --> 00:43:46.582 line:20%
Where are you going?

00:43:46.707 --> 00:43:48.876 line:20%
- Hey!
- Please stop!

00:44:12.399 --> 00:44:13.484
Excuse me!

00:44:13.567 --> 00:44:15.069
A lady came in here, right?

00:44:15.152 --> 00:44:16.570
Damn it. I'm exhausted.

00:44:16.654 --> 00:44:18.280
How was that lady so fast?

00:44:18.947 --> 00:44:20.115
Ma'am!

00:44:20.199 --> 00:44:21.659
Stop playing and come out.

00:44:25.454 --> 00:44:26.914
What are you doing?

00:44:27.581 --> 00:44:28.749
Goodness.

00:44:28.832 --> 00:44:31.168
You thought hiding your head
would make you invisible?

00:44:31.251 --> 00:44:33.045
What are you, an ostrich? Come out.

00:44:33.128 --> 00:44:34.588
Why are you doing this?

00:44:34.672 --> 00:44:36.340
- Come on, lady!
- Let go!

00:44:38.717 --> 00:44:41.595
I said I'm not a strange person!

00:44:42.471 --> 00:44:43.889
My gosh! I'm sorry!

00:44:43.972 --> 00:44:46.016
I'm so sorry! Are you okay?

00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:47.768
I'm sure she came in here.

00:44:47.851 --> 00:44:49.561
What's suddenly up with him?

00:45:08.705 --> 00:45:09.706
I'm back.

00:45:11.208 --> 00:45:15.379
I'm back now.

00:45:16.338 --> 00:45:18.590
I'm back!

00:45:22.094 --> 00:45:23.095
Ma'am.

00:45:24.430 --> 00:45:25.722
I look younger, right?

00:45:28.767 --> 00:45:30.144
Do I look like an old lady?

00:45:31.019 --> 00:45:32.020
No.

00:45:33.355 --> 00:45:35.065
Do I look like I'm in my twenties?

00:45:39.695 --> 00:45:40.779
Mom! Dad!

00:45:41.405 --> 00:45:42.990
Where have you been?

00:45:43.073 --> 00:45:45.033
It was total chaos today.

00:45:45.117 --> 00:45:48.370
Some weird lady
broke into our house this morning.

00:45:48.454 --> 00:45:49.663
It was no joke.

00:45:50.664 --> 00:45:51.498
Look.

00:45:51.582 --> 00:45:54.376
That madwoman had even stolen your wallet.

00:45:54.460 --> 00:45:57.796
Your mom's preparing to increase
security here in a large way.

00:45:57.880 --> 00:45:59.590
What kind of security?

00:46:05.053 --> 00:46:07.514
Where did you get these clubs?

00:46:07.598 --> 00:46:09.057
I borrowed them from next door.

00:46:09.141 --> 00:46:12.394
We didn't have any suitable weapons.
We need to be prepared in advance.

00:46:13.103 --> 00:46:14.897
- Pick one.
- No, I'm fine.

00:46:14.980 --> 00:46:16.064
They look scary.

00:46:19.067 --> 00:46:20.861
Here. You take this.

00:46:20.944 --> 00:46:21.778
Here.

00:46:22.362 --> 00:46:23.197
Okay.

00:46:24.615 --> 00:46:25.949
After today,

00:46:26.783 --> 00:46:28.785
something worse could happen.

00:46:28.869 --> 00:46:30.204
We need to be prepared.

00:46:34.124 --> 00:46:35.918
How dare she sneak into our home?

00:46:36.001 --> 00:46:38.378
- She called me her mom!
- She called me her dad!

00:46:39.046 --> 00:46:40.672
<i>That was me.</i>

00:46:41.465 --> 00:46:43.050
Mom!

00:46:43.133 --> 00:46:45.928
She clearly looked much older than me.

00:46:46.011 --> 00:46:47.513
It was ridiculous.

00:46:47.596 --> 00:46:49.515
<i>I said that was me.</i>

00:46:49.598 --> 00:46:51.892
But where have you been all day?

00:46:53.143 --> 00:46:54.311
Were you with Ga-yeong?

00:46:56.021 --> 00:46:56.855
Yeah.

00:46:58.649 --> 00:46:59.650
What's with her?

00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:12.454
<i>Wow. What's going on?</i>

00:47:13.288 --> 00:47:15.207
<i>Why did I suddenly get old?</i>

00:47:16.917 --> 00:47:18.961
<i>And how did I come back?</i>

00:47:19.044 --> 00:47:20.337
<i>Was it just for a moment?</i>

00:47:21.171 --> 00:47:22.631
<i>But why just my appearance?</i>

00:47:23.423 --> 00:47:26.093
<i>Even if I was a little achy</i>
<i>because of a hangover,</i>

00:47:26.176 --> 00:47:29.304
<i>but I still had</i>
<i>the same stamina and energy.</i>

00:47:30.013 --> 00:47:31.390
<i>Damn it.</i>

00:47:31.473 --> 00:47:33.267
Is it a disease that ages the face?

00:47:45.028 --> 00:47:46.613
SUDDENLY OLD…

00:47:47.322 --> 00:47:49.408
RAPIDLY AGING FACE

00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:51.535 line:20%
What do I do?

00:47:51.618 --> 00:47:53.870 line:20%
RAPIDLY AGING FACE AFTER LOSING BABY FAT

00:47:57.874 --> 00:48:02.004
<i>What did I do wrong?</i>
<i>Why did I suddenly get old?</i>

00:48:04.381 --> 00:48:05.382
<i>Wait.</i>

00:48:05.882 --> 00:48:08.343
<i>I was old when I woke up.</i>

00:48:08.427 --> 00:48:10.512
Was it because of the sun?

00:48:23.650 --> 00:48:24.818
<i>I can't die yet.</i>

00:48:25.569 --> 00:48:27.404
<i>I still have so much to do.</i>

00:48:28.155 --> 00:48:29.406
<i>I have to go on dates,</i>

00:48:30.198 --> 00:48:32.618
<i>get a job so I can give</i>
<i>my parents pocket money,</i>

00:48:33.452 --> 00:48:36.038
<i>and take time off</i>
<i>to travel overseas with Ga-yeong.</i>

00:48:37.706 --> 00:48:39.625
<i>We said we'd go to famous restaurants.</i>

00:48:59.186 --> 00:49:00.187
It's morning!

00:49:03.523 --> 00:49:04.983
What's happening to me?

00:49:05.734 --> 00:49:07.277
What is this?

00:49:13.992 --> 00:49:16.536
Mi-jin! Hey, what's going on?

00:49:17.579 --> 00:49:18.664
Don't come in!

00:49:18.747 --> 00:49:20.248
I said don't come!

00:49:20.332 --> 00:49:21.833
What's the matter, Mi-jin?

00:49:22.459 --> 00:49:24.336
- Should I come in?
- No.

00:49:24.419 --> 00:49:25.962
It's nothing.

00:49:26.046 --> 00:49:27.631
It's nothing. Don't come in.

00:49:29.049 --> 00:49:30.884
What's wrong with your voice?

00:49:33.553 --> 00:49:35.847
I caught a cold.

00:49:36.348 --> 00:49:37.391
My voice is hoarse.

00:49:38.809 --> 00:49:39.726
Are you okay?

00:49:39.810 --> 00:49:41.144
Yeah, I'm okay.

00:49:52.989 --> 00:49:54.199
Am I wearing underwear?

00:50:07.629 --> 00:50:08.755
<i>The veterinary clinic!</i>

00:50:17.806 --> 00:50:19.599
Hello. Do you remember me?

00:50:20.183 --> 00:50:23.603
May I see the cat I left here last night?

00:50:28.608 --> 00:50:30.110
Okay. Here you go.

00:50:30.777 --> 00:50:33.822
The cat fell in a well.

00:50:33.905 --> 00:50:35.365
Can you take a look?

00:50:37.492 --> 00:50:41.329
<i>The cat was moved</i>
<i>after treatment but disappeared.</i>

00:50:41.413 --> 00:50:42.998
<i>This has never happened before.</i>

00:50:43.623 --> 00:50:45.083
<i>I'm very sorry.</i>

00:50:45.667 --> 00:50:46.835
<i>Disappeared?</i>

00:50:48.503 --> 00:50:49.629
<i>Where did it go?</i>

00:50:51.882 --> 00:50:54.176
<i>Yeah, I need to find that cat first.</i>

00:51:05.771 --> 00:51:07.147 line:20%
MISSING PERSON
NAME: LIM SUN

00:51:12.569 --> 00:51:14.446
We demand a not-guilty verdict!

00:51:14.529 --> 00:51:16.323
- Ko! Not guilty!
- Ko! Not guilty!

00:51:16.406 --> 00:51:17.866
- Ko!
- Not guilty!

00:51:17.949 --> 00:51:19.868
We demand a not-guilty verdict!

00:51:19.951 --> 00:51:21.077
Not guilty!

00:51:37.093 --> 00:51:39.930
Despite substantial evidence
against the defendant,

00:51:40.013 --> 00:51:41.598
he has denied the crime itself

00:51:42.265 --> 00:51:45.852 line:20%
and has claimed temporary insanity
in an attempt to avoid punishment.

00:51:45.936 --> 00:51:46.770 line:20%
DEFENDANT

00:51:46.853 --> 00:51:47.938
Your Honor,

00:51:48.021 --> 00:51:50.857
he is a prominent figure
with large influence on society.

00:51:51.691 --> 00:51:54.402
We request that he receives
a more severe punishment.

00:51:54.486 --> 00:51:55.654
That is all.

00:52:05.413 --> 00:52:06.748
COURT

00:52:13.964 --> 00:52:14.798
<i>Breaking news.</i>

00:52:15.382 --> 00:52:17.843
<i>King Land member, Ko Won,</i>
<i>had claimed innocence…</i>

00:52:18.426 --> 00:52:20.262
Hey, coming soon!

00:52:20.887 --> 00:52:22.222
Will he finally appear?

00:52:22.305 --> 00:52:23.557
Who's all the fuss about?

00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:25.517
You don't know Prosecutor Gye Ji-ung?

00:52:26.184 --> 00:52:27.310
It's Gye Ji-ung!

00:52:32.816 --> 00:52:33.900
I'm sorry.

00:52:40.615 --> 00:52:42.325
<i>He seems like a normal lawyer.</i>

00:52:42.409 --> 00:52:44.035
He may seem that way,

00:52:44.119 --> 00:52:46.037
but he changes when he's in work mode,

00:52:46.121 --> 00:52:47.205
like Jekyll and Hyde.

00:52:47.289 --> 00:52:50.083
To cover a story,
you should mind your manners first.

00:52:50.166 --> 00:52:54.421
Your cheap and prying methods
are why you're called trash journalists.

00:52:54.504 --> 00:52:56.798
- Unbelievable.
- Seriously?

00:52:56.882 --> 00:53:00.802
The Prosecutors' Office was criticized
for being lenient by asking for a fine.

00:53:00.886 --> 00:53:02.804
Wouldn't you say that it's warranted?

00:53:02.888 --> 00:53:05.098
<i>Pretending to be close, smart, or tough…</i>

00:53:05.181 --> 00:53:06.600
Well, you reap what you sow.

00:53:07.267 --> 00:53:08.935
So I came to take responsibility.

00:53:09.019 --> 00:53:11.354
- He hates that.
- Dirty prosecutors made a mess.

00:53:11.438 --> 00:53:13.815
A proper prosecutor like me
will clean it up.

00:53:13.899 --> 00:53:15.317
The problem is

00:53:15.901 --> 00:53:17.485
he knows he's good.

00:53:17.569 --> 00:53:19.279
I'll respond with my skills.

00:53:19.362 --> 00:53:21.323
My high conviction rate shows you that.

00:53:21.406 --> 00:53:22.782
He's so annoying.

00:53:22.866 --> 00:53:24.534
Were there any other questions?

00:53:25.368 --> 00:53:26.369
If not, please move.

00:53:26.453 --> 00:53:28.830
Then, why was he put
in charge of that big case?

00:53:28.914 --> 00:53:30.248
He has a bad personality,

00:53:30.832 --> 00:53:32.334
but he's the best.

00:53:35.837 --> 00:53:36.838
Attack!

00:53:54.648 --> 00:53:56.483
Who is this jerk?

00:53:56.566 --> 00:53:57.692
Hey!

00:54:04.532 --> 00:54:05.617
What?

00:54:11.414 --> 00:54:14.501
It's a good thing Mr. Gye
doesn't work at our district office.

00:54:14.584 --> 00:54:15.418
Wow.

00:54:16.211 --> 00:54:18.338
Just think of this as Heaven on earth.

00:54:18.421 --> 00:54:20.757
Welcome to paradise!

00:54:23.134 --> 00:54:23.969
Damn it.

00:54:33.103 --> 00:54:34.104
Damn!

00:54:35.647 --> 00:54:37.148
Was I really this skinny?

00:54:43.196 --> 00:54:44.239
Damn it.

00:55:13.435 --> 00:55:14.436
Mom.

00:55:15.311 --> 00:55:16.563
I'm just borrowing them.

00:55:18.023 --> 00:55:19.399
The scarf too.

00:55:20.483 --> 00:55:21.484
Thanks!

00:55:47.427 --> 00:55:48.845
Goodness.

00:55:48.928 --> 00:55:50.013
She's something else.

00:55:59.230 --> 00:56:00.440
Get up already!

00:56:01.900 --> 00:56:03.068
Get up!

00:56:05.445 --> 00:56:07.655
You sleep during the day
and go out at night!

00:56:07.739 --> 00:56:09.282
No wonder you can't sleep!

00:56:12.660 --> 00:56:14.829
- Open up.
- I can't.

00:56:14.913 --> 00:56:16.706
- Open the door!
- No way.

00:56:18.041 --> 00:56:19.417
You really want to do this?

00:56:20.126 --> 00:56:20.960
Just you wait.

00:56:21.044 --> 00:56:22.420
That brat.

00:56:31.221 --> 00:56:32.639
What do you take me for?

00:56:32.722 --> 00:56:34.307
You think I can't open this?

00:56:34.390 --> 00:56:36.351
Just you wait, you brat.

00:56:42.732 --> 00:56:44.234
Your room is a mess!

00:56:45.485 --> 00:56:47.237
You're still asleep in bed.

00:56:48.196 --> 00:56:50.907
That's why you're getting fat!

00:56:50.990 --> 00:56:52.742
- You brat!
- That hurts!

00:56:56.663 --> 00:56:58.081
Come on out!

00:56:58.164 --> 00:56:59.666
Why are you so strong?

00:57:00.458 --> 00:57:03.128
Come out of there! What's with you?

00:57:04.712 --> 00:57:05.588
Seriously!

00:57:06.172 --> 00:57:07.257
Are you kidding?

00:57:07.340 --> 00:57:09.217
At least get some exercise!

00:57:10.176 --> 00:57:11.803
Look at the size of your butt!

00:57:11.886 --> 00:57:12.887
Goodness!

00:57:53.094 --> 00:57:54.554
It's fine.

00:57:57.765 --> 00:57:58.975
I can fix this.

00:58:02.520 --> 00:58:03.521
I'll change back.

00:58:06.983 --> 00:58:08.109
I can do it.

00:58:08.985 --> 00:58:11.821
Your face suddenly aged?

00:58:12.530 --> 00:58:14.866
All of a sudden, I got severely old.

00:58:14.949 --> 00:58:17.494
We all have a point
when we suddenly age a few years.

00:58:17.577 --> 00:58:21.164
It's not just that.
I change when the sun rises and sets.

00:58:21.247 --> 00:58:22.248
I become someone else.

00:58:22.332 --> 00:58:23.917
It sounds like menopause to me.

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:25.043
I'm in my twenties.

00:58:25.126 --> 00:58:26.753
You have a daughter in her twenties.

00:58:26.836 --> 00:58:28.588
Wait, you're in your twenties?

00:58:28.671 --> 00:58:30.548
- Wait--
- I'm in my twenties!

00:58:30.632 --> 00:58:31.799
Hey, can we help this lady--

00:58:31.883 --> 00:58:34.761
I mean, patient in her twenties
with an appointment?

00:58:34.844 --> 00:58:37.347
I am in my twenties.
Look at how my skin's changed.

00:58:37.430 --> 00:58:38.890
It changes every morning.

00:58:38.973 --> 00:58:40.266
Okay, I'll put you down for it.

00:58:40.350 --> 00:58:41.726
Hello.

00:58:41.809 --> 00:58:42.977
Excuse me?

00:58:43.061 --> 00:58:45.772
Will the facial acupuncture
make me younger?

00:58:45.855 --> 00:58:46.940
Of course, ma'am.

00:58:51.277 --> 00:58:52.862
How can I help you, ma'am?

00:58:54.864 --> 00:58:56.074
My daughter's waiting.

00:59:02.247 --> 00:59:03.164
Like this.

00:59:03.831 --> 00:59:06.918
I won't ask for more or less.
I just want it like this.

00:59:07.460 --> 00:59:08.503
Ma'am.

00:59:08.586 --> 00:59:10.421
Because of your age,

00:59:10.505 --> 00:59:12.340
it's hard to look exactly like that.

00:59:12.423 --> 00:59:14.467
I told you we're the same age.

00:59:37.949 --> 00:59:39.784
Seriously, what am I going to do?

00:59:40.618 --> 00:59:42.495
I'm in my twenties.

00:59:42.579 --> 00:59:44.247
I was born in 1996.

00:59:44.330 --> 00:59:47.166
But I change into this when I wake up.

00:59:48.126 --> 00:59:48.960
What?

00:59:50.086 --> 00:59:51.838
I change into this in the morning.

00:59:51.921 --> 00:59:53.131
To someone born in 1996?

00:59:53.214 --> 00:59:55.300
No, the other way around.

00:59:55.383 --> 00:59:56.968
- That's the same thing.
- No--

00:59:57.051 --> 00:59:58.261
- You're possessed.
- I am?

00:59:58.344 --> 00:59:59.512
Let's find a way.

01:00:00.597 --> 01:00:03.391
Show me.

01:00:03.474 --> 01:00:05.184
Show me the way.

01:00:05.268 --> 01:00:08.354
Show me.

01:00:09.314 --> 01:00:10.607
Why can't I see it?

01:00:10.690 --> 01:00:12.358
Show me.

01:00:12.442 --> 01:00:15.403
The spirits are angry. I can't see.

01:00:15.486 --> 01:00:18.656
Show me.

01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:22.410
Here. Show me the way.

01:00:27.624 --> 01:00:29.000
My goodness!

01:00:29.083 --> 01:00:30.209
Jeez, you scared me!

01:00:30.293 --> 01:00:32.253
- Who are you?
- The person born in 1996.

01:00:32.337 --> 01:00:33.671
Don't be ridiculous.

01:00:33.755 --> 01:00:34.756
Where did the lady go?

01:00:34.881 --> 01:00:35.715
- She was--
- I'm her.

01:00:35.798 --> 01:00:36.883
Get out. Who are you?

01:00:36.966 --> 01:00:38.426
I don't want to know. Go!

01:00:38.509 --> 01:00:39.802
Go away!

01:00:39.886 --> 01:00:41.638
- But…
- Go away! Go!

01:00:41.721 --> 01:00:42.597
Go away!

01:01:34.524 --> 01:01:36.359
Why?

01:01:37.819 --> 01:01:40.279
What did I do wrong?

01:01:41.364 --> 01:01:45.743
Why do I have to be
an old lady like this? Why?

01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:53.876
Is someone listening?

01:01:55.336 --> 01:01:56.337
It was my fault?

01:01:57.296 --> 01:01:59.048
Are you blaming me?

01:02:01.175 --> 01:02:02.677
So it is my fault.

01:02:04.011 --> 01:02:05.471
I'm the one to blame.

01:02:15.481 --> 01:02:16.774
What in the world?

01:02:16.858 --> 01:02:19.235
My goodness!

01:02:21.612 --> 01:02:22.613
My gosh!

01:02:26.117 --> 01:02:27.034
Damn.

01:02:27.118 --> 01:02:28.536
I almost died.

01:02:30.538 --> 01:02:31.622
What is this?

01:02:47.096 --> 01:02:48.347
My leg!

01:02:48.431 --> 01:02:49.474
I have a cramp!

01:02:54.979 --> 01:02:56.022
What's with her?

01:02:56.105 --> 01:02:57.690
I feel like seaweed on a beach.

- Ms. Lim Sun.
- Yes, sir?

01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:25.736
You're very young.

01:04:25.820 --> 01:04:26.654
Excuse me?

01:04:26.737 --> 01:04:28.614
You're our youngest applicant.

01:04:30.157 --> 01:04:30.992
I see.

01:04:34.287 --> 01:04:37.915
How much wood would a woodchuck chuck
if a woodchuck could chuck wood?

01:04:39.166 --> 01:04:40.585
Your pronunciation is great.

01:04:40.668 --> 01:04:42.336
These are all my natural teeth.

01:04:45.339 --> 01:04:47.967
I can speak very clearly as well.

01:04:48.050 --> 01:04:49.552
How much wood could…

01:04:50.136 --> 01:04:51.262
- If--
- Thank you.

01:04:57.852 --> 01:04:59.312
You're very flexible.

01:05:00.354 --> 01:05:02.106
I can do other things too.

01:05:02.189 --> 01:05:03.357
Sorry, you can't come out.

next to where it says
"Seohan City Hall Senior Internship,"

01:05:16.746 --> 01:05:19.165
"Program" is spelled incorrectly.

01:05:19.248 --> 01:05:21.709
It's spelled with an "R,"
not an "L." Right?

01:05:22.668 --> 01:05:24.462 line:20%
Wow, that's incredible.

01:05:24.545 --> 01:05:26.088
Your English is great too.

01:05:26.172 --> 01:05:27.965
You even found that small typo.

01:05:28.049 --> 01:05:32.053
- You must have good vision too.
- Yes, I have naturally perfect vision.

01:05:32.678 --> 01:05:34.472
Do you know any other languages?

01:05:34.555 --> 01:05:40.978 line:20%
Learning a second language

01:08:14.715 --> 01:08:15.800
I got the job.

01:08:18.427 --> 01:08:19.720
I did it!
