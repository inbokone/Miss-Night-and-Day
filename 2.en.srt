00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,962
MISS NIGHT AND DAY

2
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:54,679
Auntie!

3
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:02,103
That's the cutest kitten I've ever seen.

4
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:04,064
You're cuter.

5
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:06,232
The kitten is cute too.

6
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:07,776
Yeah. It's beautiful, right?

7
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,075
What?

8
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:43,186
Goodness.

9
00:01:59,702 --> 00:02:01,871
The light…

10
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:05,917
What?

11
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:18,346
It's Auntie.

12
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:20,557
MISSING PERSON
NAME: LIM SUN

13
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,475
Please calm down and return home.

14
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:24,769
But my sister, Lim Sun,

15
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:26,521
isn't the type to leave home.

16
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:30,525
She didn't run away.
She's definitely missing!

17
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:34,195
I told you several times an adult
can't be reported missing right away.

18
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:36,197
- But--
- You said you got a text too.

19
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:39,450
That's why it's driving me crazy!

20
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:41,703
How much longer do I have to wait?

21
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:43,496
Can you look for her? Please!

22
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,748
Okay, I will. I'll look for her.

23
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:48,376
RESIDENT REGISTRATION
CHILDREN - LEE MI-JIN, SIBLING - LIM SUN

24
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:50,712
Shouldn't we cancel it now?

25
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:53,047
What are you saying? Don't be absurd.

26
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:54,507
She'll be back.

27
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:56,718
I know she'll come back.

28
00:02:57,552 --> 00:03:00,054
I'll find her. I'm going to find her.

29
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:02,974
Let's go, Mi-jin.

32
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:32,462
Bye, Mom and Dad.

33
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,048
Why leave so early?

34
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:36,215
It's my first day.

35
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:37,967
- Eat before you go.
- No, I'm fine.

36
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,220
You can't work on an empty stomach.

37
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:41,971
Come on.

38
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:42,889
Here.

39
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:44,140
Mom!

40
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,184
I'll have to brush my teeth again.
It's fine.

41
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:51,397
Mom, I'm late.

42
00:03:52,148 --> 00:03:54,776
It's finally our daughter's
first day of work.

43
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:57,153
Sorry, Dad!

44
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:10,166
I know it's her first day,
but to push her own dad?

45
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,293
She's a civil servant now.

46
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:14,295
The first day is so important.

47
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:16,839
Why were you in her way like that?

48
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,216
Eat this.

49
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:20,969
It is her first day.

These are the interns who will start
working at our office today.

52
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:55,878
Seo Mal-tae.

53
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,964
Mr. Seo, I've heard about you.

54
00:04:58,047 --> 00:04:59,674
You used to be a detective?

55
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:01,467
Yes, I have decades of experience.

56
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:04,554
I'll try my best to be meticulous here.

57
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:07,557
I hear you are the oldest
among our selected applicants.

58
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,850
Mr. Geum Gwang-seok.

59
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:10,727
You hired me even though I'm lacking.

60
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,271
I'm very honored.

61
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:14,605
Chief!

62
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:17,734
No, I'm not the chief.
I'm just the deputy chief.

63
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,235
Ms. Na Ok-hui.

64
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:22,322
Ms. Na, you're quite beautiful.

65
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:24,949
I bet you made
plenty of men cry in your day.

66
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:28,161
- Sir.
- Yes?

67
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,622
That could be considered
sexual harassment.

68
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:34,417
You're educated.
Don't you know the times we live in?

69
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,418
Thank you.

70
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:36,502
Mr. Ko Na-heun.

71
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:37,587
Right.

72
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:41,924
I heard you're a former soldier, Mr. Ko.

73
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:45,261
I ended up like this
after answering the call for my country.

74
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:46,596
Goodness.

75
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:52,477
- I'm so sorry.
- Why didn't you bring a chair?

76
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,520
I'm sorry.

77
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:55,688
- Ms. Lim Sun.
- Sorry.

78
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:58,941
The famous young applicant!

79
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:01,152
You had the highest marks
in the interview.

80
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:03,488
- Really? I did?
- Of course.

81
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:07,492
I've never been the best
in anything before.

82
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:09,202
Thank you.

83
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:12,288
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

84
00:06:12,371 --> 00:06:14,207
SECURITY PASS

85
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,667
Let's take one more
with your badge showing.

86
00:06:17,376 --> 00:06:18,377
One, two…

87
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,340
So,

88
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:25,968
you want us to clean
the entire main building?

89
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:29,931
Yes, the prosecutor in Room 307
is being transferred here today,

90
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:31,474
so make sure it's especially clean.

91
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,352
Right. Clean.

GYE JI-UNG

94
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:58,102
<i>What's he doing here?</i>

95
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:15,411
What are you doing in my office?

96
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,663
I'm sorry. I was cleaning.

97
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:22,126
<i>He's like a different person</i>
<i>with glasses on.</i>

98
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,337
But what are you doing here?

99
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,005
This is my office.

100
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:27,089
No way.

101
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:29,592
This is the new prosecutor's office.

102
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:30,718
PROSECUTOR GYE JI-UNG

103
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:34,597
<i>He's a prosecutor?</i>

104
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:36,307
<i>Of all places, here?</i>

105
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:38,100
<i>Really?</i>

106
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,727
Just clean it quick and go.

107
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:42,647
<i>Wow, he's colder than before.</i>

108
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:43,731
Yes, sir.

109
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:53,366
Allow me.

110
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:55,076
<i>What's this?</i>

111
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:57,036
I'm sorry.

112
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:59,080
I'll buy a similar one to replace this.

113
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:01,332
No, I had no intention of maintaining it.

114
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:02,416
What?

115
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:26,107
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR APPOINTMENT

116
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:37,326
Is he really the same person I met before?

117
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,203
Why is he so cold?

118
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:42,665
Why did he have to be a prosecutor?

119
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:45,167
And why did he have to work where I work?

120
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,294
Also,

121
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:49,255
why is his office on the third floor
where I'm cleaning?

122
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:50,798
- What?
- What the hell?

123
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,384
I'm sorry.

124
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:57,263
I didn't take you
for being so foul-mouthed.

125
00:09:57,346 --> 00:09:59,265
You must've been wild in your youth.

126
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:01,767
What do you mean?
I was totally popular and dank.

127
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,436
What? "Dank"?

128
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:04,895
Is that a swear?

129
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:08,399
You can't say such harsh things
to someone who's old!

130
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:11,027
Son of a bitch.

131
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:14,196
Damn it.

132
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:23,831
You start tomorrow, so why come in?

133
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:25,249
I can't just let…

134
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,668
a great day like this go by.

135
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:32,548
Seoul Central District's ace prosecutor
was suddenly sent to the boondocks.

136
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:35,676
You didn't follow me here, did you?

137
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:37,595
<i>After enduring a year under you,</i>

138
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:40,306
everyone asked if I owed you something.

139
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:44,477
Or did I have a grudge against you
and wanted to revenge?

140
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,936
That's what they asked.

141
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:49,273
It's already getting noisy.
Just go home today.

142
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:50,900
My mother-in-law is visiting.

143
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:52,860
I plan on working overtime.

144
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:55,071
<i>You'll have to do it alone.</i>

145
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:57,740
I'm clocking out when I'm done.

146
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:59,241
That's a surprise.

147
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:02,328
You always worked overtime
and lived out of your office.

148
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:04,830
Did you turn over a new leaf
after transferring?

149
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:06,540
<i>I doubt you're meeting a woman.</i>

150
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:08,542
What? I can't go meet with a woman?

151
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:10,961
You know very well.

152
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:13,381
- Know what?
<i>- You have no private life.</i>

153
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:15,883
You immerse yourself
in work on weekends and holidays.

154
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:18,552
Due to excessive workloads,
your subordinates suffer

155
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:21,389
loss of appetite, ulcers, migraines,
hair loss, and depression.

156
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:22,890
Then, they quit or go on leave.

157
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:24,308
I was one of those people.

158
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:26,394
While getting help for depression…

159
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:28,854
I met my wife.

160
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:31,774
Then, shouldn't you thank me?
You met her because of me.

161
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:32,691
That's not all!

162
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:34,235
<i>The moment you start work,</i>

163
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:38,114
<i>you become super focused, super intense,</i>
<i>and super sensitive. Do you remember?</i>

164
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:41,242
For replacing the old shredder,
you had me shred the new shredder.

165
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:42,660
It was like bam!

166
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:44,578
What are you looking at, punk?

167
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:47,873
<i>I love how you never change.</i>

168
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:49,917
You say whatever's on your mind.

169
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,377
<i>I did that on purpose.</i>

170
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,379
My wife told me

171
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:55,965
to let my inner rage out like this.

172
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:58,843
People with anger disorders
have… serotonin?

173
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:01,929
They say it's due to
excessive levels. But--

174
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:03,639
Hello?

175
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:05,307
What?

176
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,518
He must be busy.

177
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:10,646
Well, so much for wanting
to catch up over dinner.

178
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:15,484
He always said he couldn't get
any work done without me.

179
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:16,986
So he even followed me here.

180
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:20,489
That's right! Gye Ji-ung!

181
00:12:24,743 --> 00:12:25,578
Good luck.

182
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,168
DOGAVILL WALLPAPER & REAL ESTATE

183
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,629
It would've been nice
if this was pork shoulder.

184
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:36,881
Be happy you got pork leg.

185
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:40,468
Can't you be grateful
and just quietly eat?

186
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:41,552
I mean,

187
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:45,639
this is my building but I haven't raised
your rent for the last 20 years.

188
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:49,602
Is pork shoulder
really that much to ask for?

189
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:52,104
I'm only worth pork legs to you?
Is that it?

190
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:54,523
You're barking up the wrong tree.

191
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:57,067
You'll have to deal
with my wife about the rent.

192
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:58,861
There's no point in talking to me.

193
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,991
I shouldn't have taken you
to Kwak's Coffeehouse downtown.

194
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:05,576
- I wasted my time--
- Hey!

195
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:07,912
Don't even bring up Kwak's Coffeehouse!

196
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:11,790
Also, I don't get to eat
pork shoulder either.

197
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:14,168
That's nothing to brag about.

198
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:16,212
I bet Mi-jin gets to. Right?

199
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:18,339
She's your daughter, after all.

200
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:20,758
It hasn't been that long for her either.

201
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:23,427
It was only after she passed
her civil servant exam.

202
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:26,388
Wow, Ms. Lim.

203
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:29,767
She's a real piece of work.

204
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:32,061
Just stop talking

205
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:34,271
and thankfully eat what you're given.

206
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:38,901
Goodness, come on in.
Are you looking for a place?

207
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:40,069
Please sit here.

208
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:42,821
I don't have much time.
Could we make it quick?

209
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:44,573
- Is that so?
- Yes.

210
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:47,618
Tell me what you're looking for.
I'll get you what you want.

211
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:51,288
I have luxurious studio apartments
ready to move in to.

212
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:53,499
I have everything ready.

213
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:55,209
Is there a place I can move into now?

214
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:56,919
Of course!

215
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:01,215
By any chance,

216
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,385
do you have weak energy?

217
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:07,263
What does energy
have to do with renting a place?

218
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:11,600
When it comes to finding the right place,

219
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:14,186
feng shui is a very important factor,

220
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,313
and they're closely connected.

221
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:19,692
By any chance,

222
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:22,111
do you see ghosts often?

223
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:24,154
I don't see them or believe in them.

224
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:25,239
Really?

225
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:30,786
Then, I have the perfect place for you.

226
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:35,165
All right, this is the place I mentioned.

227
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:37,626
Keep your shoes on. It's okay.

228
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:40,379
Wow, it's nice! Isn't it?

229
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:42,715
Good, right?

230
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,925
When it comes to this place,

231
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:47,386
you get a lot of natural sunlight.

232
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:49,930
I guess it's pretty cloudy today.

233
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:53,100
It's fine. I won't be home
when the sun's up anyway.

234
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,268
It's just for sleep.

235
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:55,728
Is that so?

236
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:57,187
Well, then.

237
00:14:57,271 --> 00:15:00,608
You were just destined for this place.

238
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:02,026
It's perfect.

239
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:02,943
Will it be okay?

240
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:06,614
Of course, it will!

241
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:11,035
What kind of problem could there be?

242
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:13,495
You can go around all over this city,

243
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:18,334
but you won't find a place like this
for this price with all these amenities.

244
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:22,630
This house gives off
an ominous feeling though.

245
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:27,760
I'll take it.

246
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:30,471
I'll sign and move in today.

247
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,726
Welcome to the world of darkness.

248
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,356
Let's go and sign that contract.

249
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,441
Don't mind him.

250
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:44,693
His wife beats him,
so his head's out of whack.

251
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:48,405
Let's go, okay? Let's sign it. Come on.

252
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:52,785
Hello, my dears!

253
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:55,329
It's Do Ga-yeong,
your beauty content creator.

254
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:58,666
My dears, I know you'll relate to this.

255
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:02,544
You're crying in the bathroom at work
because your boss made you so angry.

256
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,797
When suddenly…

257
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,008
When suddenly, you…

258
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:09,218
Excuse me.

259
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:13,180
So for you, I've prepared something…

260
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:17,726
Didn't you see the sign
that said I was filming?

261
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:20,062
- Yeah, I did.
- I have to start over because of you.

262
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:20,980
Were you crying?

263
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:22,398
No, it was for the video.

264
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:24,775
What's with your clothes? What is this?

265
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:26,443
Stop asking me questions.

266
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:28,028
Just eat this.

267
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:32,116
Why do you only come over
at night these days?

268
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:33,701
Is it because of your new job?

269
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:37,329
I'm doing it for you.
I don't want you to faint during the day.

270
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:38,747
Right, I could faint.

271
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:41,875
My friend, Mi-jin, finally has a job.

272
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:45,045
Who knew I'd live to see the day?

273
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:46,255
I know.

274
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:48,799
The result after spending
eight years on studying…

275
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,343
<i>was a public service intern.</i>

276
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:55,472
Wow, I love the look
in your eyes right now.

277
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:56,682
There's a story there.

278
00:16:57,933 --> 00:16:59,852
- Want to shoot a short video?
- No.

279
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:01,645
- Just one.
- Please disappear.

280
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:02,771
Just one video!

281
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,106
- Don't!
- Just one!

282
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:05,649
- Just one video!
- Stop it!

283
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:13,699
- I was wondering.
- What?

284
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:15,200
I saw on social media

285
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:18,287
that some good makeup
could really change how someone looks.

286
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:21,248
Making someone look
30 years younger would be easy, right?

287
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:22,833
It's doable.

288
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:24,293
You just have to be reborn.

289
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,961
You brat.

290
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:30,049
Well, instead of just wearing makeup,
it would be a transformation.

291
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:31,300
Like a superhero.

292
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:34,720
Why? Your mom doesn't care
about makeup. Who is it?

293
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:36,430
It's someone else.

294
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:38,849
Someone who aged suddenly.

295
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:40,184
What is this?

296
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:43,979
Seriously, I was born in 1996.

297
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:52,571
By the way, can you put up
an ad for me on your channel?

298
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:53,822
A paid ad?

299
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,032
A free ad.

300
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:57,409
This is so cute!
What is it? Did you draw it?

301
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:01,538
It's a long story,
but it disappeared right after we met.

302
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:04,249
Was it a stray cat?
Why are you looking for it?

303
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:10,297
<i>I don't know if this is a miracle or not,</i>
<i>but it seems related to that cat somehow.</i>

304
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,883
Hello?

305
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:15,302
Put it up. I'll tell you later.

306
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:17,221
Okay.

307
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:19,348
I'm only doing this because it's you.

308
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:23,936
I passed the haunted house
on my way up here, and the light was on.

309
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:25,604
Do you think it's the ghost?

310
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:27,439
Right. Hey.

311
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:29,733
A man moved in there.

312
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:32,277
- Really? That place?
- Yeah! That place.

313
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:34,113
Isn't my dad so harsh?

314
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:38,283
I know he's blinded by money,
but how can you rent that house out?

315
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:40,160
Gosh, will he be okay?

316
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:42,121
I don't know. It's his problem now.

317
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:44,665
He's better off than I am.

318
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:47,042
I have to film this.
Be quiet for a second.

319
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,127
Okay.

320
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:51,505
- Hi! No, they can see you.
- I've been in them before.

321
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:52,923
Get down.

322
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:54,800
- You're so mean.
- A bit more.

323
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:56,260
Those 200,000 followers? So what?

324
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:58,512
Just get down,

where were you
during your ten-minute break?

348
00:24:04,025 --> 00:24:06,945
I went to the bathroom,
and I went for a walk.

Is that so? Hold on.

Just a moment.

00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,702
It's the same brand

352
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:15,120
Did you bite this off?

353
00:24:15,203 --> 00:24:16,413
- Good grief.
- Hold on.

354
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:19,124

The CCTV? So what?

399
00:26:00,016 --> 00:26:03,728

See how dark this doctor looks?

423
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:57,949
This is what darkness is.

424
00:26:58,033 --> 00:26:59,326

00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:06,041

It's called Dongdu-dong.

Donghae?

433
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:27,771
Why would I go to Donghae?

434
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:28,938
No.

435
00:27:29,647 --> 00:27:31,524
Dongdu-dong.

436
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:33,151

that he'll work as a public service worker

For the first time

451
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:34,462
Is she here?

452
00:29:42,655 --> 00:29:44,324
Ko Won, can you say hello?

453
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,077
Did you suddenly decide
to enlist because of the trial's verdict?

454
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:51,456
Tell us your goals
before you begin your duties.

455
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:58,004
A lot of people have given me support,
so I will sincerely work hard.

456
00:29:58,546 --> 00:30:02,300
Answering the call of your country
is a natural obligation for any citizen.

457
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:03,426
I'll do my best.

458
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:09,057
I'll complete my service
without any problems.

459
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,351
Why are there so many people here?

460
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,020
What's going on?

461
00:30:14,103 --> 00:30:15,563
Especially, to my fans…

00:30:19,442 --> 00:30:21,444
- My Dalgona Family.
- Ko Won!

463
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:23,655
I love you all!

464
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:39,838

465
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:42,173
<i>This is how my twenties will end?</i>

466
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:43,842
<i>As a 50-year-old lady?</i>

467
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:19,502
Did you see that Ko Won incident?

468
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:22,380
Yeah, it makes me so sad.

469
00:31:22,463 --> 00:31:24,716
Was his name Mr. Gye? Did you see him?

470
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:28,636
Doesn't he look so kind and sweet?

471
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,721
I saw him.

472
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:35,143
<i>True. He went to great lengths</i>
<i>to help even a stranger like me too.</i>

473
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:36,769
- He's handsome.
- He's a rare one.

474
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:38,396
It feels so nice now that he's here.

475
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:40,523
He was the ace prosecutor back in Seoul.

476
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:42,859
That's why he was in charge
of Ko Won's case.

477
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:45,653
Why is he so handsome?

478
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:49,198
He's skilled, handsome, and accomplished.

479
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:50,992
- Isn't he too perfect?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

480
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:53,202
<i>He was glowing in light</i>
<i>when I first saw him.</i>

481
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:56,164
He wears glasses? That's just my type.

482
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:00,877
I can't listen to this anymore.

483
00:32:03,212 --> 00:32:05,089
You all need to raise your standards.

484
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:06,758
What you see isn't everything.

485
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:09,302
He's nice… when he's not working.

486
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:13,973
But he's a workaholic
who works 20 out of 24 hours a day.

487
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:17,810
If plans or routines are changed,
he becomes upset and his OCD surfaces.

488
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:22,899
He's a social misfit who can't stand it
when people intervene in his life.

489
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:25,109
Other than that, he's great.

490
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:27,070
Again, it's as long he's not working.

491
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:30,073
<i>I better not get involved with him at all.</i>

492
00:32:36,162 --> 00:32:37,747

CRAZY TASTY BUTCHER SHOP

497
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:16,119
Hey, Mom.

498
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:18,329
What's wrong with your voice?

499
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:20,707
I'm working.

500
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:22,917
Why did you call?

501
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:25,253
A man is here looking for you.

502
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:27,630
A man? What for?

503
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:30,591
Excuse me. What was your name?

504
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:32,885
It's Gye Ji-ung.

505
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:34,804
Why is he there?

506
00:33:34,887 --> 00:33:36,305
This is crazy!

507
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:43,896
I'm so sorry!

508
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:48,651
What? Wait.

509
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:50,445
Isn't that Sun?

510
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:51,696
You're right. It's her.

511
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:54,323
That's the same color
of the coat she wore to work.

512
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:55,992
Same length of hair.

513
00:33:56,075 --> 00:33:58,870
That's the same backpack
she always carries around too.

514
00:33:58,953 --> 00:34:00,538
Goodness, look at that stamina.

515
00:34:00,621 --> 00:34:02,832
She rides her bike to and from work.

516
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:04,625
I'm sorry, Ok-hui.

517
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:07,295
I had to clean up.

518
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:10,757
What are we to do?

519
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,885
Something urgent came up
and Lim Sun just suddenly left.

520
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:17,847
We'll have to save
today's social gathering for another day.

521
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:18,931
Well, then…

522
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:21,726
- Bye.
- What?

523
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:24,771
Gosh, it's for the best.

524
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:27,023
Now, let's forget the women.

525
00:34:27,106 --> 00:34:28,733
Let's grab a drink together.

526
00:34:28,816 --> 00:34:30,026
I'm going home.

527
00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:31,986
Didn't you say you'd stuff your face?

528
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,154
You two stuff your faces.

529
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:36,407
It's okay with me.

530
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:39,243
- Where should we go?
- I swear.

531
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:42,955
Some people just don't have
the basics down.

532
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:45,708
That's so annoying.

533
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:59,388
<i>Dad, great job today.</i>

534
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:01,933
<i>Do you want me</i>
<i>to pick you up after dinner?</i>

535
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:03,101
<i>I'm just happy</i>

536
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:06,562
<i>to at least have a chance</i>
<i>to work like this.</i>

537
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:10,149
<i>You don't have to come out and pick me up.</i>

538
00:35:10,983 --> 00:35:12,235
<i>The dinner was canceled.</i>

539
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:13,986
<i>On my way home,</i>

540
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,696
<i>I'll buy you something tasty.</i>

541
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:44,892
How do you know my daughter?

542
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:49,230
<i>We met by chance</i>
<i>on my way to a work meeting.</i>

543
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:50,439
<i>Work?</i>

544
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:51,607
Are you an office worker?

545
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:54,277
A civil servant.

546
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:55,820
Civil servant?

547
00:35:57,613 --> 00:36:00,116
Goodness, so you're a civil servant!

548
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:01,617
That's great!

549
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:03,077
Just a moment.

550
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:05,037
Hold on. Where are my manners?

551
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:21,596
What's that?

552
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:22,680
Look at that!

553
00:36:22,763 --> 00:36:23,723
Wow, that's sick!

554
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:24,849
Look at that!

555
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:26,475
Lady! Hey, lady!

556
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:28,311
I can't believe that lady!

557
00:36:28,394 --> 00:36:30,354
- Hey, lady!
- Go!

558
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:32,440
<i>My daughter's a civil servant too.</i>

559
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:34,817
She already got a job?

560
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:36,319
What do you mean "already"?

561
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:37,862
She turned 30 before getting a job.

562
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:42,742
Still, it's a job with security
and one she can have until retirement.

563
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:58,633
May I ask about your parents?

564
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:00,801
They're not around.

565
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:05,556
But if they were around,

566
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,267
there could be conflicts
between your wife and her in-laws.

567
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:11,229
Instead, being happily together in love

568
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:13,064
is the best.

569
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:14,649
Don't you think?

570
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:20,738
Where in the world is she?

571
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:23,491
She said she'd come straight after work.

572
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:26,410
By the way,

573
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:28,496
you're so handsome-- I mean…

574
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:30,831
What business led to you meet Mi-jin?

575
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:34,502
I mean, what department do you work in?

576
00:37:35,127 --> 00:37:36,128
Well, I'm…

577
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,260
What's that lady doing here?

578
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:44,887
Ma'am!

579
00:37:52,311 --> 00:37:54,230
Was it not her?

580
00:38:13,332 --> 00:38:14,375
Jeez!

581
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:23,092
Damn it.

582
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:26,053
Jeez. Seriously!

583
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:29,348
You'll see how smart Mi-jin is
once you get to know her.

584
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:30,266
My goodness.

585
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:31,225
Excuse me.

586
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,102
- What's with you?
- What brings you here?

587
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:34,186
Thank you for the coffee.

588
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:36,022
Don't mention it.

589
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:36,939
That's right!

590
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:38,566
I am so forgetful!

591
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:41,569
I should've offered you
some of my organic fig <i>cheong</i>.

592
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:42,570
No, it's fine.

593
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:43,904
- Please come again.
- Let's talk.

594
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,281
You should go back home.

595
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:46,949
- Get the figs--
- Go inside, Mom!

596
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:48,075
- I'll be back.
- The figs…

597
00:38:49,368 --> 00:38:50,786
What's with that girl?

598
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:58,502
Did you tell my mom about that day?

599
00:38:58,586 --> 00:38:59,879
You don't have to worry.

600
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:02,381
I didn't say a word about the job fraud.

601
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:03,507
That's a relief.

602
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:08,262
It's just… I'm still trying to fix things,
so she doesn't know.

603
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:10,181
That's your business, not mine.

604
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:11,682
Right.

605
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:28,074
Is there something on my face?

606
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:32,953
I guess you do look like
you were born in 1996.

607
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:34,997
How do you know how old I am?

608
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:42,588
This looks familiar.

609
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:46,759
Isn't that Mi-jin?

610
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:48,886
- Hak-chan.
- What?

611
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:51,972
Mi-jin's over there with some guy.

612
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:53,015
A guy?

613
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:54,558
Hey, that guy!

614
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:57,269
Where are you going? Are you crazy?

615
00:39:57,353 --> 00:39:58,729
Things are going well!

616
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:01,065
Are you trying to ruin her love life?

617
00:40:01,148 --> 00:40:02,525
No, it's just…

618
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:05,027
I've never seen her with a guy before.

619
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:06,404
Goodness.

620
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:11,492
Our documents were switched,
and I'd like mine back.

621
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:13,035
I see. They were switched.

622
00:40:13,702 --> 00:40:16,539
- You didn't even check?
- This isn't that important to me.

623
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:19,834
I would've prepared them
if you'd called ahead.

624
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:20,793
Hold on.

625
00:40:20,876 --> 00:40:22,628
Are you pretending not to remember?

626
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:25,506
When I called,
you spewed those vulgar words at me.

627
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:26,841
Do you know how hurt…

628
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:29,510
I did?

629
00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:32,847
Come on. No way.

630
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,974
What? Wow!

631
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:37,017
I called you 27 times after that.

632
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:40,020
But you ignored me,
so I'm assuming you've blocked me.

633
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:42,314
You must've called the wrong number.

634
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:43,399
Wrong number?

635
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:49,071
Look.

636
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:51,907
Hey, that's my number.

637
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,493
<i>Please leave a message after the tone.</i>

638
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:55,494
Is it ringing?

639
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:57,872
Why are you blocked?

640
00:40:58,747 --> 00:41:00,499
<i>Is it you again? The prosecutor?</i>

641
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:04,503
Hey, you crazy psycho!
Who do you think you are to call me back?

642
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,218
- Look, I can explain.
- Forget it.

643
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:12,470
Just give me my papers.

644
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:15,973
I'll go home and find them for you.

645
00:41:16,056 --> 00:41:18,517
Would you like some quince tea and wait?

646
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:20,519
No. It'd be a hassle for both of us.

647
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:21,520
I'll wait outside.

648
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:24,190
I live near here.

649
00:41:24,773 --> 00:41:25,858
To the right…

650
00:41:25,941 --> 00:41:27,610
I mean, it's just to the left.

651
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:29,570
Look at her.

652
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:31,113
She's leading the way.

653
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:32,031
Look!

654
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:33,782
- Wait.
- Where are they going?

655
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:35,743
She's leading the way. It's over now.

656
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:03,562
Did I leave it here?

657
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:08,734
I must've thrown everything away.

658
00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:14,657
This is bad.

659
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:32,132
By any chance,

660
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:34,677
were those documents important?

661
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:36,887
Yes.

662
00:42:39,765 --> 00:42:41,684
So the thing is…

663
00:42:42,434 --> 00:42:44,103
Those documents…

664
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:47,856
What happened was…

665
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:58,158
Are you saying you burned
my documents without permission?

666
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:00,077
I didn't know they were yours.

667
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:03,205
I'm sorry.

668
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:06,750
After wasting my time, labor,
and emotions, you're sorry…

669
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:08,669
Do you think "sorry" will cut it?

670
00:43:12,881 --> 00:43:15,134
They weren't related to your work, right?

671
00:43:15,217 --> 00:43:17,720
Even if they weren't,
they shouldn't be burned.

672
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:22,016
Unfortunately, they were
very relevant to my work. And?

673
00:43:24,643 --> 00:43:28,022
If you're willing to grant this,
why didn't you just grant me a job?

674
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:32,526
You could get money for those
from a used bookstore!

675
00:43:33,736 --> 00:43:37,197
I promise I'll do whatever it takes
to make it up to you.

676
00:43:39,491 --> 00:43:40,326
Forget it.

677
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:41,368
No, wait.

678
00:43:42,077 --> 00:43:43,662
Please let me fix this.

679
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:46,540
Let's not. Don't waste your time.

680
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:49,501
This is my fault.
I'll take responsibility.

681
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:53,047
I don't think
you're in a position to say that.

682
00:43:55,257 --> 00:43:58,218
Are you saying you can't trust
a dumb loser who was scammed?

683
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:01,013
An inferiority complex.

684
00:44:02,556 --> 00:44:03,390
Let's go.

685
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:06,477
I'll find and give them to you
in front of your own eyes.

686
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:08,312
Follow me.

687
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:12,816
Hello.

688
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:13,901
Hi.

689
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:17,488
Sir, I think I left
something behind last time.

690
00:44:17,571 --> 00:44:19,490
- Can I look for it? Thank you.
- Sure.

691
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,704
You're not going to
look for it here, are you?

692
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:30,292
Don't worry. I may not look like it,

693
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:33,295
but I have the top score
in the hidden object game at the arcade.

694
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:35,172
No, you look like it.

695
00:44:36,423 --> 00:44:37,424
Thank you.

696
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:39,927
Why aren't you looking?

697
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:42,012
I'm going to now.

698
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:12,584
Seriously, where did it go?

699
00:45:15,462 --> 00:45:16,755
Where is it?

700
00:45:17,798 --> 00:45:18,715
Wow, look at this.

701
00:45:19,299 --> 00:45:20,843
I think it could be here.

702
00:45:28,642 --> 00:45:33,313
"Study Book."

703
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:39,445
Jeez, I almost cursed.

704
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:45,451
"Civil Servant." It's not here.

705
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:53,083
Are you okay?

706
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:54,168
Yes.

707
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:02,593
"Civil Servant."

708
00:46:12,811 --> 00:46:16,315
Where did Mi-jin go?
What in the world is she up to?

709
00:46:16,398 --> 00:46:17,357
Why isn't she home yet?

710
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:18,817
For goodness' sake.

711
00:46:20,569 --> 00:46:22,696
What are you doing?
They're having a good time.

712
00:46:23,655 --> 00:46:25,782
Your daughter left with a strange man.

713
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:28,202
It's late and she's not home.
You're not worried?

714
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:30,746
I'd be worried if she did come home!

715
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:32,247
She's basically 30 now.

716
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:34,374
She's never even held hands with a man.

717
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:36,460
At this rate, when she ends up

718
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:39,129
as a 60-year-old virgin

719
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:41,298
taking care of her old parents,
will you wake up?

720
00:46:41,381 --> 00:46:42,925
Why would you say that?

721
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:48,430
I mean…

722
00:46:48,514 --> 00:46:50,682
Having grandchildren would be nice.

723
00:46:50,766 --> 00:46:51,808
Tonight's the night.

724
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:56,730
The night we get grandchildren.

725
00:47:00,609 --> 00:47:01,443
Don't overreact.

726
00:47:03,028 --> 00:47:04,821
Be normal. Act natural.

727
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:21,171
You already looked there.

728
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:24,174
There are so many books
that I got confused.

729
00:47:25,842 --> 00:47:29,304
Why are you nagging
if you're not even going to help?

730
00:47:33,767 --> 00:47:35,811
You looked there exactly 19 minutes ago.

731
00:47:37,062 --> 00:47:39,022
That's why I'm looking next to it.

732
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:40,816
- You looked there too.
- I know.

733
00:47:40,899 --> 00:47:42,401
I was going to look next to that.

734
00:47:42,484 --> 00:47:44,069
Yeah, you looked there too.

735
00:47:44,152 --> 00:47:46,572
I meant this shelf that's next to that.

736
00:47:49,324 --> 00:47:50,867
Is that a civil service prep book?

737
00:47:51,618 --> 00:47:52,869
Wait a second.

738
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:54,913
Civil service…

739
00:48:09,011 --> 00:48:10,470
- Are you okay?
- Are you okay?

740
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:38,433
Why is it so hot?

741
00:49:39,893 --> 00:49:40,936
Are you hot?

742
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:45,899
Did the owner turn on the heater?

743
00:49:45,982 --> 00:49:47,734
Why is it so hot today?

744
00:49:49,945 --> 00:49:51,154
What's with these sleeves?

745
00:49:56,034 --> 00:49:56,993
Try this.

746
00:50:03,041 --> 00:50:04,042
Nice.

747
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:54,486
LEE MI-JIN
MODERN PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION

748
00:51:58,532 --> 00:52:00,033
{\an8}YOU CAN DO IT, MI-JIN

749
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:08,208
You must've studied hard
for the civil servant exam.

750
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:11,378
That's all I did.

751
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:13,672
I was needlessly too diligent.

752
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:16,007
I failed each time though.

753
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:19,594
But why did you keep retaking it?

754
00:52:19,678 --> 00:52:21,805
I didn't really have a dream.

755
00:52:21,888 --> 00:52:23,598
I wasn't good at anything.

756
00:52:23,682 --> 00:52:26,810
My mom wanted me
as a civil servant, so I figured I'd try.

757
00:52:31,606 --> 00:52:34,734
I must look pathetic to someone
who's good at everything like you.

758
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:35,694
No, I'm jealous.

759
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:39,281
My dream's to live
without any purpose or thoughts.

760
00:52:42,033 --> 00:52:45,203
You really do have a knack
for subtly insulting people.

761
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:49,416
What are you looking at?

762
00:52:50,584 --> 00:52:51,877
This.

763
00:52:55,088 --> 00:52:58,216
- Where'd you find this?
- Shelf 15, section three.

764
00:52:58,300 --> 00:52:59,551
That's over here.

765
00:52:59,634 --> 00:53:00,760
- Yes.
- Section three…

766
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:03,597
This is it!

767
00:53:04,222 --> 00:53:06,141
- It's here!
- Next to that.

768
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:08,852
No, it's here. Wait a second.

769
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:10,854
Here.

770
00:53:13,148 --> 00:53:14,274
Hello, Detective Kwon.

771
00:53:16,151 --> 00:53:17,152
What?

772
00:53:19,279 --> 00:53:20,530
Here it is! Wait.

773
00:53:24,117 --> 00:53:25,201
I found it!

774
00:53:26,953 --> 00:53:29,915
Wow, I really thought I wouldn't find it!

775
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:36,379
Mr. Gye?

776
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:40,091
What?

777
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:42,469
He acted as if he'd observe all night.

778
00:54:04,824 --> 00:54:07,661
<i>Mom!</i>

779
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:10,330
- What happened?
- Goodness.

780
00:54:10,413 --> 00:54:11,289
Again?

781
00:54:18,713 --> 00:54:21,800
<i>Mom!</i>

782
00:54:25,553 --> 00:54:29,808
You always asked me to give you a call
if we ever discovered a dismembered body.

783
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:32,143
I'd kept that in mind.

784
00:54:32,227 --> 00:54:35,271
But who knew it would really happen?

785
00:54:36,564 --> 00:54:37,440
Hey!

786
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:38,942
Come here.

787
00:54:41,194 --> 00:54:43,446
Who is he? Did you call him?

788
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:45,156
I'm not here to steal your case.

789
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:47,575
It'll come to us anyway. I came to check.

790
00:54:47,659 --> 00:54:48,827
Check what?

791
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:50,954
To see if we're doing our jobs right?

792
00:54:51,037 --> 00:54:52,747
Don't be like this, sir.

793
00:54:52,831 --> 00:54:55,458
I called him.
He has to work on the case anyways.

794
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:56,835
Forget it.

795
00:54:56,918 --> 00:54:58,461
You punk.

796
00:54:58,545 --> 00:55:00,755
Just keep it short and go.

797
00:55:01,506 --> 00:55:03,591
When was this discovered?

798
00:55:04,175 --> 00:55:05,635
An old man came to clear

799
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:07,554
frost from his greenhouse.

800
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:10,682
He came out before dawn
to work when he found this.

801
00:55:10,765 --> 00:55:12,267
The damn bastard

802
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:14,769
left a body part here for everyone to see.

803
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:34,057
Why isn't he coming back?

804
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:35,725
I finally found it.

805
00:56:40,814 --> 00:56:41,940
Should I just leave?

806
00:56:43,316 --> 00:56:45,527
I could just give it to him tomorrow.

807
00:56:48,404 --> 00:56:52,408
WE BUY AND SELL USED BOOKS

808

<i>You didn't leave</i>
<i>because you were angry, did you?</i>

809
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:18,268
Is this too meek?

810
00:57:18,893 --> 00:57:19,811
<i>What happened?</i>

811
00:57:19,894 --> 00:57:21,896
<i>You were acting</i>
<i>as if you'd observe all night.</i>

812
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:24,357
Is this is too aggressive?

813
00:57:27,193 --> 00:57:31,114
It has to sound very formal and distant,

814
00:57:32,198 --> 00:57:35,618
but it can't sound too dry either.

815
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:40,165
It needs to be a cool text
that sounds slightly friendly.

816
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:43,918
A very cool text.

817
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:47,589
<i>I waited, but it got late. So I left.</i>

818
00:58:34,719 --> 00:58:37,597
<i>It'd take 15 minutes at most</i>
<i>for an adult to cover 550 meters.</i>

819
00:58:39,265 --> 00:58:41,643
<i>Since the ground hasn't dried yet,</i>

820
00:58:41,726 --> 00:58:43,603
<i>it's been less than 30 minutes.</i>

821
00:58:45,772 --> 00:58:47,106
- Detective Kwon!
- Yes?

822
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:48,733
The witness didn't see anyone?

823
00:58:48,816 --> 00:58:50,276
The killer's probably already fled!

824
00:58:52,237 --> 00:58:54,906
<i>The killer was surprised</i>
<i>or flustered by something.</i>

825
00:58:58,201 --> 00:59:00,370
Look over there!

826
00:59:02,413 --> 00:59:03,456
<i>Or they're hiding.</i>

827
00:59:04,707 --> 00:59:06,376
<i>Maybe to fix a mistake?</i>

828
00:59:07,835 --> 00:59:09,546
<i>The culprit could still be at the scene.</i>

829
00:59:41,869 --> 00:59:42,829
Damn it.

830
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:14,611
Detective Kwon!

831
01:00:14,694 --> 01:00:16,779
Stop all vehicles headed toward Daeho-ri!

832
01:00:16,863 --> 01:00:17,739
It's the culprit!

833
01:00:26,372 --> 01:00:28,666
<i>I waited, but it got late. So I left.</i>

<i>- The person you're trying…</i>
- Come on!

837
01:02:29,704 --> 01:02:33,291
I wonder what's in here.
He made me work so hard for this.

838
01:02:33,374 --> 01:02:34,542
But he didn't even take it.

839
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:08,075
What is this?

{\an8}I can't hear a word they're saying.
